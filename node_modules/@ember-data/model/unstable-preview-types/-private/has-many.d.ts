  /**
    `hasMany` is used to define Many-To-One and Many-To-Many, and Many-To-None
    relationships on a [Model](/ember-data/release/classes/Model).
  
    `hasMany` takes a configuration hash as a second parameter, currently
    supported options are:
  
    - `async`: (*required*) A boolean value used to whether this is a sync (false) or async (true) relationship.
    - `inverse`: (*required*)  A string used to identify the inverse property on a related model, or `null`.
    - `polymorphic`: (*optional*) A boolean value to mark the relationship as polymorphic
    - `as`: (*optional*) A string used to the abstract type "this" record satisfies for polymorphism.
  
    ### Examples
  
    To a **many-to-one** (or one-to-many) relationship, use
    `belongsTo` in combination with `hasMany`:
  
    ```js
    // app/models/post.js
    import Model, { hasMany } from '@ember-data/model';
  
    export default class Post extends Model {
      @hasMany('comment', { async: false, inverse: 'post' }) comments;
    }
  
  
    // app/models/comment.js
    import Model, { belongsTo } from '@ember-data/model';
  
    export default class Comment extends Model {
      @belongsTo('post', { async: false, inverse: 'comments' }) post;
    }
    ```
  
    To a **many-to-many** relationship with managed inverses, use `hasMany` for both sides:
  
    ```js
    // app/models/post.js
    import Model, { hasMany } from '@ember-data/model';
  
    export default class Post extends Model {
      @hasMany('tag', { async: true, inverse: 'posts' }) tags;
    }
  
    // app/models/tag.js
    import Model, { hasMany } from '@ember-data/model';
  
    export default class Tag extends Model {
      @hasMany('post', { async: true, inverse: 'tags' }) posts;
    }
    ```
  
    To a **many-to-many** relationship without managed inverses, use `hasMany` for both sides
    with `null` as the inverse:
  
    ```js
    // app/models/post.js
    import Model, { hasMany } from '@ember-data/model';
  
    export default class Post extends Model {
      @hasMany('tag', { async: true, inverse: null }) tags;
    }
  
    // app/models/tag.js
    import Model, { hasMany } from '@ember-data/model';
  
    export default class Tag extends Model {
      @hasMany('post', { async: true, inverse: null }) posts;
    }
    ```
  
    To a many-to-none relationship between two models, use
    `hasMany` with inverse set to `null` on just one side::
  
    ```js
    // app/models/post.js
    import Model, { hasMany } from '@ember-data/model';
  
    export default class Post extends Model {
      @hasMany('category', { async: true, inverse: null }) categories;
    }
    ```
  
    #### Sync vs Async Relationships
  
    EmberData fulfills relationships using resource data available in
    the cache.
  
    Sync relationships point directly to the known related resources.
  
    When a relationship is declared as async, if any of the known related
    resources have not been loaded, they will be fetched. The property
    on the record when accessed provides a promise that resolves once
    all resources are loaded.
  
    Async relationships may take advantage of links. On access, if the related
    link has not been loaded, or if any known resources are not available in
    the cache, the fresh state will be fetched using the link.
  
    In contrast to async relationship, accessing a sync relationship
    will error on access when any of the known related resources have
    not been loaded.
  
    If you are using `links` with sync relationships, you have to use
    the HasMany reference API to fetch or refresh related resources
    that aren't loaded. For instance, for a `comments` relationship:
  
    ```js
    post.hasMany('comments').reload();
    ```
  
    #### Polymorphic Relationships
  
    To a polymorphic relationship, use `hasMany` with the `polymorphic`
    option set to `true`:
  
    ```js
    // app/models/comment.js
    import Model, { belongsTo } from '@ember-data/model';
  
    export default class Comment extends Model {
      @belongsTo('commentable', { async: false, inverse: 'comments', polymorphic: true }) parent;
    }
    ```
  
    `'commentable'` here is referred to as the "abstract type" for the polymorphic
    relationship.
  
    Polymorphic relationships with `inverse: null` will accept any type of record as their content.
    Polymorphic relationships with `inverse` set to a string will only accept records with a matching
    inverse relationships declaring itself as satisfying the abstract type.
  
    Below, 'as' is used to the that 'post' record satisfies the abstract type 'commentable'
    for this relationship.
  
    ```js
    // app/models/post.js
    import Model, { hasMany } from '@ember-data/model';
  
    export default class Post extends Model {
      @hasMany('comment', { async: false, inverse: 'parent', as: 'commentable' }) comments;
    }
    ```
  
    Note: every Model that declares an inverse to a polymorphic relationship must
    itself exactly the same. This is because polymorphism is based on structural
    traits.
  
    Polymorphic to polymorphic relationships are supported. Both sides of the relationship
    must be declared as polymorphic, and the `as` option must be used to the abstract
    type each record satisfies on both sides.
