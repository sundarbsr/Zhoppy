  /**
    Builders for migrating from `store` methods to `store.request`.
  
    These builders enable you to migrate your codebase to using the correct syntax for `store.request` while temporarily preserving legacy behaviors.
    This is useful for quickly upgrading an entire app to a unified syntax while a longer incremental migration is made to shift off of adapters and serializers.
    To that end, these builders are deprecated and will be removed in a future version of Ember Data.
