Pre-mature optimization is bad, and often the\n  runtime does exactly what you need it to, and more often the trade-off isn't\n  worth it.\n\n  Why?\n\n  Runtimes store strings in at least 2 different representations:\n  Ropes and Symbols (interned strings). The Rope provides a memory efficient\n  data-structure for strings created from concatenation or some other string\n  manipulation like splitting.\n\n  Unfortunately checking equality of different ropes can be quite costly as\n  runtimes must resort to clever string comparison algorithms. These\n  algorithms typically cost in proportion to the length of the string.\n  Luckily, this is where the Symbols (interned strings) shine. As Symbols are\n  unique by their string content, equality checks can be done by pointer\n  comparison.\n\n  How do I know if my string is a rope or symbol?\n\n  Typically (warning general sweeping statement, but truthy in runtimes at\n  present) static strings created as part of the JS source are interned.\n  Strings often used for comparisons can be interned at runtime if some\n  criteria are met.  One of these criteria can be the size of the entire rope.\n  For example, in chrome 38 a rope longer then 12 characters will not\n  intern, nor will segments of that rope.\n\n  Some numbers: http://jsperf.com/eval-vs-keys/8\n\n  Known Trick™\n\n  @private\n  @return {String} interned version of the provided string\n*/\nexport default function intern<S extends string>(str: S): S {\n  let obj: Record<S, number> = Object.create(null);\n  obj[str] = 1;\n  for (let key in obj) {\n    if (key === str) {\n      return key;\n    }\n  }\n  return str;\n}\n","/**\n  Returns whether Type(value) is Object.\n\n  Useful for checking whether a value is a valid WeakMap key.\n\n  Refs: https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-typeof-operator-runtime-semantics-evaluation\n        https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-weakmap.prototype.set\n\n  @private\n  @function isObject\n*/\nexport function isObject(value: any | null | undefined): value is object {\n  return value !== null && (typeof value === 'object' || typeof value === 'function');\n}\n","import intern from './intern';\nimport { isObject } from './spec';\n\n/**\n @module @ember/object\n*/\n\n/**\n @private\n @return {Number} the uuid\n */\nlet _uuid = 0;\n\n/**\n Generates a universally unique identifier.

Pre-mature optimization is bad, and often the\n  runtime does exactly what you need it to, and more often the trade-off isn't\n  worth it.\n\n  Why?\n\n  Runtimes store strings in at least 2 different representations:\n  Ropes and Symbols (interned strings). The Rope provides a memory efficient\n  data-structure for strings created from concatenation or some other string\n  manipulation like splitting.\n\n  Unfortunately checking equality of different ropes can be quite costly as\n  runtimes must resort to clever string comparison algorithms. These\n  algorithms typically cost in proportion to the length of the string.\n  Luckily, this is where the Symbols (interned strings) shine. As Symbols are\n  unique by their string content, equality checks can be done by pointer\n  comparison.\n\n  How do I know if my string is a rope or symbol?\n\n  Typically (warning general sweeping statement, but truthy in runtimes at\n  present) static strings created as part of the JS source are interned.\n  Strings often used for comparisons can be interned at runtime if some\n  criteria are met.  One of these criteria can be the size of the entire rope.\n  For example, in chrome 38 a rope longer then 12 characters will not\n  intern, nor will segments of that rope.\n\n  Some numbers: http://jsperf.com/eval-vs-keys/8\n\n  Known Trick™\n\n  @private\n  @return {String} interned version of the provided string\n*/ function intern(str) {\n    let obj = {};\n    obj[str] = 1;\n    for (let key in obj) if (key === str) return key;\n    return str;\n}\n\nconst SERIALIZATION_FIRST_NODE_STRING = \"%+b:0%\";\n\nfunction isSerializationFirstNode(node) {\n    return \"%+b:0%\" === node.nodeValue;\n}\n\nconst assign = Object.assign;\n\nfunction values(obj) {\n    return Object.values(obj);\n}\n\nfunction entries(dict) {\n    return Object.entries(dict);\n}\n\nfunction keys(obj) {\n    return Object.keys(obj);\n}\n\nfunction strip(strings, ...args) {\n    let out = \"\";\n    for (const [i, string] of enumerate(strings)) out += `${string}${void 0 !== args[i] ?

The DOM\n * between the starting and ending markers is cleared, and the VM's cursor\n * is set to the area just cleared.\n *\n * The return point ($ra) is set to -1, the exit instruction.\n *\n * Finally, the $pc is set to to the instruction saved off by the\n * Enter opcode during initial execution, and execution proceeds as\n * usual.\n *\n * The only difference is that when a `Return` instruction is\n * encountered, the program jumps to -1 rather than the END label,\n * and the PopFrame opcode is not needed.\n */ function Replayable(op, args, body) {\n    // Start a new label frame, to give END and RETURN\n    // a unique meaning.\n    op(1001), op(0), \n    // If the body invokes a block, its return will return to\n    // END.

By default the getter\n  will only be called once and the result will be cached. You can specify\n  various properties that your computed property depends on. This will force the\n  cached result to be cleared if the dependencies are modified, and lazily recomputed the next time something asks for it.\n\n  In the following example we decorate a getter - `fullName` -  by calling\n  `computed` with the property dependencies (`firstName` and `lastName`) as\n  arguments. The `fullName` getter will be called once (regardless of how many\n  times it is accessed) as long as its dependencies do not change. Once\n  `firstName` or `lastName` are updated any future calls to `fullName` will\n  incorporate the new values, and any watchers of the value such as templates\n  will be updated:\n\n  ```javascript\n  import { computed, set } from '@ember/object';\n\n  class Person {\n    constructor(firstName, lastName) {\n      set(this, 'firstName', firstName);\n      set(this, 'lastName', lastName);\n    }\n\n    @computed('firstName', 'lastName')\n    get fullName() {\n      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;\n    }\n  });\n\n  let tom = new Person('Tom', 'Dale');\n\n  tom.fullName; // 'Tom Dale'\n  ```\n\n  You can also provide a setter, which will be used when updating the computed\n  property. Ember's `set` function must be used to update the property\n  since it will also notify observers of the property:\n\n  ```javascript\n  import { computed, set } from '@ember/object';\n\n  class Person {\n    constructor(firstName, lastName) {\n      set(this, 'firstName', firstName);\n      set(this, 'lastName', lastName);\n    }\n\n    @computed('firstName', 'lastName')\n    get fullName() {\n      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;\n    }\n\n    set fullName(value) {\n      let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(' ');\n\n      set(this, 'firstName', firstName);\n      set(this, 'lastName', lastName);\n    }\n  });\n\n  let person = new Person();\n\n  set(person, 'fullName', 'Peter Wagenet');\n  person.firstName; // 'Peter'\n  person.lastName;  // 'Wagenet'\n  ```\n\n  You can also pass a getter function or object with `get` and `set` functions\n  as the last argument to the computed decorator. This allows you to define\n  computed property _macros_:\n\n  ```js\n  import { computed } from '@ember/object';\n\n  function join(...keys) {\n    return computed(...keys, function() {\n      return keys.map(key => this[key]).join(' ');\n    });\n  }\n\n  class Person {\n    @join('firstName', 'lastName')\n    fullName;\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Note that when defined this way, getters and setters receive the _key_ of the\n  property they are decorating as the first argument. Setters receive the value\n  they are setting to as the second argument instead. Additionally, setters must\n  _return_ the value that should be cached:\n\n  ```javascript\n  import { computed, set } from '@ember/object';\n\n  function fullNameMacro(firstNameKey, lastNameKey) {\n    return computed(firstNameKey, lastNameKey, {\n      get() {\n        return `${this[firstNameKey]} ${this[lastNameKey]}`;\n      }\n\n      set(key, value) {\n        let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(' ');\n\n        set(this, firstNameKey, firstName);\n        set(this, lastNameKey, lastName);\n\n        return value;\n      }\n    });\n  }\n\n  class Person {\n    constructor(firstName, lastName) {\n      set(this, 'firstName', firstName);\n      set(this, 'lastName', lastName);\n    }\n\n    @fullNameMacro('firstName', 'lastName') fullName;\n  });\n\n  let person = new Person();\n\n  set(person, 'fullName', 'Peter Wagenet');\n  person.firstName; // 'Peter'\n  person.lastName;  // 'Wagenet'\n  ```\n\n  Computed properties can also be used in classic classes. To do this, we\n  provide the getter and setter as the last argument like we would for a macro,\n  and we assign it to a property on the class definition. This is an _anonymous_\n  computed macro:\n\n  ```javascript\n  import EmberObject, { computed, set } from '@ember/object';\n\n  let Person = EmberObject.extend({\n    // these will be supplied by `create`\n    firstName: null,\n    lastName: null,\n\n    fullName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', {\n      get() {\n        return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;\n      }\n\n      set(key, value) {\n        let [firstName, lastName] = value.split(' ');\n\n        set(this, 'firstName', firstName);\n        set(this, 'lastName', lastName);\n\n        return value;\n      }\n    })\n  });\n\n  let tom = Person.create({\n    firstName: 'Tom',\n    lastName: 'Dale'\n  });\n\n  tom.get('fullName') // 'Tom Dale'\n  ```\n\n  You can overwrite computed property without setters with a normal property (no\n  longer computed) that won't change if dependencies change. You can also mark\n  computed property as `.readOnly()` and block all attempts to set it.\n\n  ```javascript\n  import { computed, set } from '@ember/object';\n\n  class Person {\n    constructor(firstName, lastName) {\n      set(this, 'firstName', firstName);\n      set(this, 'lastName', lastName);\n    }\n\n    @computed('firstName', 'lastName').readOnly()\n    get fullName() {\n      return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`;\n    }\n  });\n\n  let person = new Person();\n  person.set('fullName', 'Peter Wagenet'); // Uncaught Error: Cannot set read-only property \"fullName\" on object: <(...):emberXXX>\n  ```\n\n  Additional resources:\n  - [Decorators RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0408-decorators.md)\n  - [New CP syntax RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0011-improved-cp-syntax.md)\n  - [New computed syntax explained in \"Ember 1.12 released\" ](https://emberjs.com/blog/2015/05/13/ember-1-12-released.html#toc_new-computed-syntax)\n\n  @class ComputedProperty\n  @public\n*/\nexport class ComputedProperty extends ComputedDescriptor {\n  _readOnly = false;\n  protected _hasConfig = false;\n\n  _getter?: ComputedPropertyGetterFunction = undefined;\n  _setter?: ComputedPropertySetterFunction = undefined;\n\n  constructor(args: Array<string | ComputedPropertyCallback>) {\n    super();\n\n    let maybeConfig = args[args.length - 1];\n\n    if (\n      typeof maybeConfig === 'function' ||\n      (maybeConfig !== null && typeof maybeConfig === 'object')\n    ) {\n      this._hasConfig = true;\n      let config = args.pop();\n\n      if (typeof config === 'function') {\n        assert(\n          `You attempted to pass a computed property instance to computed().

The return value of the getter\n  will be cached until any of the properties it is entangled with\n  are invalidated. This is useful when a getter is expensive and\n  used very often.\n\n  For instance, in this `GuestList` class, we have the `sortedGuests`\n  getter that sorts the guests alphabetically:\n\n  ```javascript\n    import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';\n\n    class GuestList {\n      @tracked guests = ['Zoey', 'Tomster'];\n\n      get sortedGuests() {\n        return this.guests.slice().sort()\n      }\n    }\n  ```\n\n  Every time `sortedGuests` is accessed, a new array will be created and sorted,\n  because JavaScript getters do not cache by default. When the guest list\n  is small, like the one in the example, this is not a problem. However, if\n  the guest list were to grow very large, it would mean that we would be doing\n  a large amount of work each time we accessed `sortedGuests`. With `@cached`,\n  we can cache the value instead:\n\n  ```javascript\n    import { tracked, cached } from '@glimmer/tracking';\n\n    class GuestList {\n      @tracked guests = ['Zoey', 'Tomster'];\n\n      @cached\n      get sortedGuests() {\n        return this.guests.slice().sort()\n      }\n    }\n  ```\n\n  Now the `sortedGuests` getter will be cached based on autotracking.\n  It will only rerun and create a new sorted array when the guests tracked\n  property is updated.\n\n\n  ### Tradeoffs\n\n  Overuse is discouraged.\n\n  In general, you should avoid using `@cached` unless you have confirmed that\n  the getter you are decorating is computationally expensive, since `@cached`\n  adds a small amount of overhead to the getter.\n  While the individual costs are small, a systematic use of the `@cached`\n  decorator can add up to a large impact overall in your app.\n  Many getters and tracked properties are only accessed once during rendering,\n  and then never rerendered, so adding `@cached` when unnecessary can\n  negatively impact performance.\n\n  Also, `@cached` may rerun even if the values themselves have not changed,\n  since tracked properties will always invalidate.\n  For example updating an integer value from `5` to an other `5` will trigger\n  a rerun of the cached properties building from this integer.\n\n  Avoiding a cache invalidation in this case is not something that can\n  be achieved on the `@cached` decorator itself, but rather when updating\n  the underlying tracked values, by applying some diff checking mechanisms:\n\n  ```javascript\n  if (nextValue !== this.trackedProp) {\n    this.trackedProp = nextValue;\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Here equal values won't update the property, therefore not triggering\n  the subsequent cache invalidations of the `@cached` properties who were\n  using this `trackedProp`.\n\n  Remember that setting tracked data should only be done during initialization, \n  or as the result of a user action. Setting tracked data during render\n  (such as in a getter), is not supported.\n\n  @method cached\n  @static\n  @for @glimmer/tracking\n  @public\n */\nexport const cached: MethodDecorator = (...args: any[]) => {\n  const [target, key, descriptor] = args;\n\n  // Error on `@cached()`, `@cached(...args)`, and `@cached propName = value;`\n  if (DEBUG && target === undefined) throwCachedExtraneousParens();\n  if (\n    DEBUG &&\n    (typeof target !== 'object' ||\n      typeof key !== 'string' ||\n      typeof descriptor !== 'object' ||\n      args.length !== 3)\n  ) {\n    throwCachedInvalidArgsError(args);\n  }\n  if (DEBUG && (!('get' in descriptor) || typeof descriptor.get !== 'function')) {\n    throwCachedGetterOnlyError(key);\n  }\n\n  const caches = new WeakMap();\n  const getter = descriptor.get;\n\n  descriptor.get = function (): unknown {\n    if (!caches.has(this)) {\n      caches.set(this, createCache(getter.bind(this)));\n    }\n\n    return getValue(caches.get(this));\n  };\n};\n\nfunction throwCachedExtraneousParens(): never {\n  throw new Error(\n    'You attempted to use @cached(), which is not necessary nor supported.

Currently,\n  TinyMCE provides a setup configuration option we can use to do some processing\n  after the TinyMCE instance is initialized but before it is actually rendered.\n  We can use that setup option to do some additional setup for our component.\n  The component itself could look something like the following:\n\n  ```app/components/rich-text-editor.js\n  import Component from '@ember/component';\n  import { on } from '@ember/object/evented';\n  import { bind } from '@ember/runloop';\n\n  export default Component.extend({\n    initializeTinyMCE: on('didInsertElement', function() {\n      tinymce.init({\n        selector: '#' + this.$().prop('id'),\n        setup: bind(this, this.setupEditor)\n      });\n    }),\n\n    didInsertElement() {\n      tinymce.init({\n        selector: '#' + this.$().prop('id'),\n        setup: bind(this, this.setupEditor)\n      });\n    }\n\n    setupEditor(editor) {\n      this.set('editor', editor);\n\n      editor.on('change', function() {\n        console.log('content changed!');\n      });\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n\n  In this example, we use `bind` to bind the setupEditor method to the\n  context of the RichTextEditor component and to have the invocation of that\n  method be safely handled and executed by the Ember run loop.\n\n  @method bind\n  @static\n  @for @ember/runloop\n  @param {Object} [target] target of method to call\n  @param {Function|String} method Method to invoke.\n    May be a function or a string.

The\n  primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method, which\n  registers callbacks to receive either a promise’s eventual value or the reason\n  why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n  Terminology\n  -----------\n\n  - `promise` is an object or function with a `then` method whose behavior conforms to this specification.\n  - `thenable` is an object or function that defines a `then` method.\n  - `value` is any legal JavaScript value (including undefined, a thenable, or a promise).\n  - `exception` is a value that is thrown using the throw statement.\n  - `reason` is a value that indicates why a promise was rejected.\n  - `settled` the final resting state of a promise, fulfilled or rejected.\n\n  A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.\n\n  Promises that are fulfilled have a fulfillment value and are in the fulfilled\n  state.  Promises that are rejected have a rejection reason and are in the\n  rejected state.  A fulfillment value is never a thenable.\n\n  Promises can also be said to *resolve* a value.  If this value is also a\n  promise, then the original promise's settled state will match the value's\n  settled state.  So a promise that *resolves* a promise that rejects will\n  itself reject, and a promise that *resolves* a promise that fulfills will\n  itself fulfill.\n\n\n  Basic Usage:\n  ------------\n\n  ```js\n  let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {\n    // on success\n    resolve(value);\n\n    // on failure\n    reject(reason);\n  });\n\n  promise.then(function(value) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Advanced Usage:\n  ---------------\n\n  Promises shine when abstracting away asynchronous interactions such as\n  `XMLHttpRequest`s.\n\n  ```js\n  function getJSON(url) {\n    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){\n      let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();\n\n      xhr.open('GET', url);\n      xhr.onreadystatechange = handler;\n      xhr.responseType = 'json';\n      xhr.setRequestHeader('Accept', 'application/json');\n      xhr.send();\n\n      function handler() {\n        if (this.readyState === this.DONE) {\n          if (this.status === 200) {\n            resolve(this.response);\n          } else {\n            reject(new Error('getJSON: `' + url + '` failed with status: [' + this.status + ']'));\n          }\n        }\n      };\n    });\n  }\n\n  getJSON('/posts.json').then(function(json) {\n    // on fulfillment\n  }, function(reason) {\n    // on rejection\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Unlike callbacks, promises are great composable primitives.\n\n  ```js\n  Promise.all([\n    getJSON('/posts'),\n    getJSON('/comments')\n  ]).then(function(values){\n    values[0] // => postsJSON\n    values[1] // => commentsJSON\n\n    return values;\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @class Promise\n  @public\n  @param {function} resolver\n  @param {String} [label] optional string for labeling the promise.\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @constructor\n*/\nclass Promise {\n  constructor(resolver, label) {\n    this._id = counter++;\n    this._label = label;\n    this._state = undefined;\n    this._result = undefined;\n    this._subscribers = [];\n\n    config.instrument && instrument('created', this);\n\n    if (noop !== resolver) {\n      typeof resolver !== 'function' && needsResolver();\n      this instanceof Promise ? initializePromise(this, resolver) : needsNew();\n    }\n  }\n\n  _onError(reason) {\n    config.after(() => {\n      if (this._onError) {\n        config.trigger('error', reason, this._label);\n      }\n    });\n  }\n\n/**\n  `catch` is simply sugar for `then(undefined, onRejection)` which makes it the same\n  as the catch block of a try/catch statement.\n\n  ```js\n  function findAuthor(){\n    throw new Error('couldn\\'t find that author');\n  }\n\n  // synchronous\n  try {\n    findAuthor();\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // something went wrong\n  }\n\n  // async with promises\n  findAuthor().catch(function(reason){\n    // something went wrong\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @method catch\n  @param {Function} onRejection\n  @param {String} [label] optional string for labeling the promise.\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise}\n*/\n  catch(onRejection, label) {\n    return this.then(undefined, onRejection, label);\n  }\n\n/**\n  `finally` will be invoked regardless of the promise's fate just as native\n  try/catch/finally behaves\n\n  Synchronous example:\n\n  ```js\n  findAuthor() {\n    if (Math.random() > 0.5) {\n      throw new Error();\n    }\n    return new Author();\n  }\n\n  try {\n    return findAuthor(); // succeed or fail\n  } catch(error) {\n    return findOtherAuthor();\n  } finally {\n    // always runs\n    // doesn't affect the return value\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Asynchronous example:\n\n  ```js\n  findAuthor().catch(function(reason){\n    return findOtherAuthor();\n  }).finally(function(){\n    // author was either found, or not\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @method finally\n  @param {Function} callback\n  @param {String} [label] optional string for labeling the promise.\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise}\n*/\n  finally(callback, label) {\n    let promise = this;\n    let constructor = promise.constructor;\n\n    if (typeof callback === 'function') {\n      return promise.then(value => constructor.resolve(callback()).then(() => value),\n                         reason => constructor.resolve(callback()).then(() => { throw reason; }));\n    }\n\n    return promise.then(callback, callback);\n  }\n}\n\nPromise.cast = Resolve; // deprecated\nPromise.all = all;\nPromise.race = race;\nPromise.resolve = Resolve;\nPromise.reject = Reject;\n\nPromise.prototype._guidKey = guidKey;\n\n/**\n  The primary way of interacting with a promise is through its `then` method,\n  which registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the\n  reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled.\n\n  ```js\n  findUser().then(function(user){\n    // user is available\n  }, function(reason){\n    // user is unavailable, and you are given the reason why\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Chaining\n  --------\n\n  The return value of `then` is itself a promise.  This second, 'downstream'\n  promise is resolved with the return value of the first promise's fulfillment\n  or rejection handler, or rejected if the handler throws an exception.\n\n  ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return user.name;\n  }, function (reason) {\n    return 'default name';\n  }).then(function (userName) {\n    // If `findUser` fulfilled, `userName` will be the user's name, otherwise it\n    // will be `'default name'`\n  });\n\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new Error('Found user, but still unhappy');\n  }, function (reason) {\n    throw new Error('`findUser` rejected and we\\'re unhappy');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // if `findUser` fulfilled, `reason` will be 'Found user, but still unhappy'.\n    // If `findUser` rejected, `reason` will be '`findUser` rejected and we\\'re unhappy'.\n  });\n  ```\n  If the downstream promise does not specify a rejection handler, rejection reasons will be propagated further downstream.\n\n  ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    throw new PedagogicalException('Upstream error');\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }).then(function (value) {\n    // never reached\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // The `PedgagocialException` is propagated all the way down to here\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Assimilation\n  ------------\n\n  Sometimes the value you want to propagate to a downstream promise can only be\n  retrieved asynchronously. This can be achieved by returning a promise in the\n  fulfillment or rejection handler. The downstream promise will then be pending\n  until the returned promise is settled. This is called *assimilation*.\n\n  ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // The user's comments are now available\n  });\n  ```\n\n  If the assimliated promise rejects, then the downstream promise will also reject.\n\n  ```js\n  findUser().then(function (user) {\n    return findCommentsByAuthor(user);\n  }).then(function (comments) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` fulfills, we'll have the value here\n  }, function (reason) {\n    // If `findCommentsByAuthor` rejects, we'll have the reason here\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Simple Example\n  --------------\n\n  Synchronous Example\n\n  ```javascript\n  let result;\n\n  try {\n    result = findResult();\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Errback Example\n\n  ```js\n  findResult(function(result, err){\n    if (err) {\n      // failure\n    } else {\n      // success\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Promise Example;\n\n  ```javascript\n  findResult().then(function(result){\n    // success\n  }, function(reason){\n    // failure\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Advanced Example\n  --------------\n\n  Synchronous Example\n\n  ```javascript\n  let author, books;\n\n  try {\n    author = findAuthor();\n    books  = findBooksByAuthor(author);\n    // success\n  } catch(reason) {\n    // failure\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Errback Example\n\n  ```js\n\n  function foundBooks(books) {\n\n  }\n\n  function failure(reason) {\n\n  }\n\n  findAuthor(function(author, err){\n    if (err) {\n      failure(err);\n      // failure\n    } else {\n      try {\n        findBoooksByAuthor(author, function(books, err) {\n          if (err) {\n            failure(err);\n          } else {\n            try {\n              foundBooks(books);\n            } catch(reason) {\n              failure(reason);\n            }\n          }\n        });\n      } catch(error) {\n        failure(err);\n      }\n      // success\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Promise Example;\n\n  ```javascript\n  findAuthor().\n    then(findBooksByAuthor).\n    then(function(books){\n      // found books\n  }).catch(function(reason){\n    // something went wrong\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @method then\n  @param {Function} onFulfillment\n  @param {Function} onRejection\n  @param {String} [label] optional string for labeling the promise.\n  Useful for tooling.\n  @return {Promise}\n*/\nPromise.prototype.then = then;\n\nexport default Promise;\n","import Promise from './promise';\nimport {\n  noop,\n  resolve,\n  reject,\n} from './-internal';\n\nfunction makeObject(_, argumentNames) {\n  let obj = {};\n  let length = _.length;\n  let args = new Array(length);\n\n  for (let x = 0; x < length; x++) {\n    args[x] = _[x];\n  }\n\n  for (let i = 0; i < argumentNames.length; i++) {\n    let name = argumentNames[i];\n    obj[name] = args[i + 1];\n  }\n\n  return obj;\n}\n\nfunction arrayResult(_) {\n  let length = _.length;\n  let args = new Array(length - 1);\n\n  for (let i = 1; i < length; i++) {\n    args[i - 1] = _[i];\n  }\n\n  return args;\n}\n\nfunction wrapThenable(then, promise) {\n  return {\n    then(onFulFillment, onRejection) {\n      return then.call(promise, onFulFillment, onRejection);\n    }\n  };\n}\n\n/**\n  `denodeify` takes a 'node-style' function and returns a function that\n  will return an `Promise`. You can use `denodeify` in Node.js or the\n  browser when you'd prefer to use promises over using callbacks. For example,\n  `denodeify` transforms the following:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let fs = require('fs');\n\n  fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n    if (err) return handleError(err);\n    handleData(data);\n  });\n  ```\n\n  into:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let fs = require('fs');\n  let readFile = denodeify(fs.readFile);\n\n  readFile('myfile.txt').then(handleData, handleError);\n  ```\n\n  If the node function has multiple success parameters, then `denodeify`\n  just returns the first one:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let request = denodeify(require('request'));\n\n  request('http://example.com').then(function(res) {\n    // ...\n  });\n  ```\n\n  However, if you need all success parameters, setting `denodeify`'s\n  second parameter to `true` causes it to return all success parameters\n  as an array:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let request = denodeify(require('request'), true);\n\n  request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {\n    // result[0] -> res\n    // result[1] -> body\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Or if you pass it an array with names it returns the parameters as a hash:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let request = denodeify(require('request'), ['res', 'body']);\n\n  request('http://example.com').then(function(result) {\n    // result.res\n    // result.body\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Sometimes you need to retain the `this`:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let app = require('express')();\n  let render = denodeify(app.render.bind(app));\n  ```\n\n  The denodified function inherits from the original function. It works in all\n  environments, except IE 10 and below. Consequently all properties of the original\n  function are available to you. However, any properties you change on the\n  denodeified function won't be changed on the original function. Example:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let request = denodeify(require('request')),\n      cookieJar = request.jar(); // <- Inheritance is used here\n\n  request('http://example.com', {jar: cookieJar}).then(function(res) {\n    // cookieJar.cookies holds now the cookies returned by example.com\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Using `denodeify` makes it easier to compose asynchronous operations instead\n  of using callbacks. For example, instead of:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let fs = require('fs');\n\n  fs.readFile('myfile.txt', function(err, data){\n    if (err) { ... } // Handle error\n    fs.writeFile('myfile2.txt', data, function(err){\n      if (err) { ... } // Handle error\n      console.log('done')\n    });\n  });\n  ```\n\n  you can chain the operations together using `then` from the returned promise:\n\n  ```javascript\n  let fs = require('fs');\n  let readFile = denodeify(fs.readFile);\n  let writeFile = denodeify(fs.writeFile);\n\n  readFile('myfile.txt').then(function(data){\n    return writeFile('myfile2.txt', data);\n  }).then(function(){\n    console.log('done')\n  }).catch(function(error){\n    // Handle error\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @method denodeify\n  @public\n  @static\n  @for rsvp\n  @param {Function} nodeFunc a 'node-style' function that takes a callback as\n  its last argument.

It establishes a\n  class system based on Ember's Mixin system, and provides the basis for the\n  Ember Object Model. `CoreObject` should generally not be used directly,\n  instead you should use `EmberObject`.\n\n  ## Usage\n\n  You can define a class by extending from `CoreObject` using the `extend`\n  method:\n\n  ```js\n  const Person = CoreObject.extend({\n    name: 'Tomster',\n  });\n  ```\n\n  For detailed usage, see the [Object Model](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/object-model/)\n  section of the guides.\n\n  ## Usage with Native Classes\n\n  Native JavaScript `class` syntax can be used to extend from any `CoreObject`\n  based class:\n\n  ```js\n  class Person extends CoreObject {\n    init() {\n      super.init(...arguments);\n      this.name = 'Tomster';\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Some notes about `class` usage:\n\n  * `new` syntax is not currently supported with classes that extend from\n    `EmberObject` or `CoreObject`. You must continue to use the `create` method\n    when making new instances of classes, even if they are defined using native\n    class syntax. If you want to use `new` syntax, consider creating classes\n    which do _not_ extend from `EmberObject` or `CoreObject`. Ember features,\n    such as computed properties and decorators, will still work with base-less\n    classes.\n  * Instead of using `this._super()`, you must use standard `super` syntax in\n    native classes. See the [MDN docs on classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Super_class_calls_with_super)\n    for more details.\n  * Native classes support using [constructors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Constructor)\n    to set up newly-created instances. Ember uses these to, among other things,\n    support features that need to retrieve other entities by name, like Service\n    injection and `getOwner`. To ensure your custom instance setup logic takes\n    place after this important work is done, avoid using the `constructor` in\n    favor of `init`.\n  * Properties passed to `create` will be available on the instance by the time\n    `init` runs, so any code that requires these values should work at that\n    time.\n  * Using native classes, and switching back to the old Ember Object model is\n    fully supported.\n\n  @class CoreObject\n  @public\n*/\ninterface CoreObject {\n  /** @internal */\n  _super(...args: any[]): any;\n}\nclass CoreObject {\n  /** @internal */\n  [OWNER]?: Owner;\n\n  constructor(owner?: Owner) {\n    this[OWNER] = owner;\n\n    // prepare prototype...\n    (this.constructor as typeof CoreObject).proto();\n\n    let self;\n    if (DEBUG && hasUnknownProperty(this)) {\n      let messageFor = (obj: unknown, property: unknown) => {\n        return (\n          `You attempted to access the \\`${String(property)}\\` property (of ${obj}).\\n` +\n          `Since Ember 3.1, this is usually fine as you no longer need to use \\`.get()\\`\\n` +\n          `to access computed properties.

An example of this in use within Ember\n    is the `classNames` property of `Component` from `@ember/component`.\n\n    Here is some sample code showing the difference between a concatenated\n    property and a normal one:\n\n    ```javascript\n    import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n\n    const Bar = EmberObject.extend({\n      // Configure which properties to concatenate\n      concatenatedProperties: ['concatenatedProperty'],\n\n      someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['bar'],\n      concatenatedProperty: ['bar']\n    });\n\n    const FooBar = Bar.extend({\n      someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['foo'],\n      concatenatedProperty: ['foo']\n    });\n\n    let fooBar = FooBar.create();\n    fooBar.get('someNonConcatenatedProperty'); // ['foo']\n    fooBar.get('concatenatedProperty'); // ['bar', 'foo']\n    ```\n\n    This behavior extends to object creation as well. Continuing the\n    above example:\n\n    ```javascript\n    let fooBar = FooBar.create({\n      someNonConcatenatedProperty: ['baz'],\n      concatenatedProperty: ['baz']\n    })\n    fooBar.get('someNonConcatenatedProperty'); // ['baz']\n    fooBar.get('concatenatedProperty'); // ['bar', 'foo', 'baz']\n    ```\n\n    Adding a single property that is not an array will just add it in the array:\n\n    ```javascript\n    let fooBar = FooBar.create({\n      concatenatedProperty: 'baz'\n    })\n    view.get('concatenatedProperty'); // ['bar', 'foo', 'baz']\n    ```\n\n    Using the `concatenatedProperties` property, we can tell Ember to mix the\n    content of the properties.\n\n    In `Component` the `classNames`, `classNameBindings` and\n    `attributeBindings` properties are concatenated.\n\n    This feature is available for you to use throughout the Ember object model,\n    although typical app developers are likely to use it infrequently.

This is one of the fundamental ways that\n  models, controllers and views communicate with each other in an Ember\n  application.\n\n  Any object that has this mixin applied can be used in observer\n  operations. That includes `EmberObject` and most objects you will\n  interact with as you write your Ember application.\n\n  Note that you will not generally apply this mixin to classes yourself,\n  but you will use the features provided by this module frequently, so it\n  is important to understand how to use it.\n\n  ## Using `get()` and `set()`\n\n  Because of Ember's support for bindings and observers, you will always\n  access properties using the get method, and set properties using the\n  set method. This allows the observing objects to be notified and\n  computed properties to be handled properly.\n\n  More documentation about `get` and `set` are below.\n\n  ## Observing Property Changes\n\n  You typically observe property changes simply by using the `observer`\n  function in classes that you write.\n\n  For example:\n\n  ```javascript\n  import { observer } from '@ember/object';\n  import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n\n  EmberObject.extend({\n    valueObserver: observer('value', function(sender, key, value, rev) {\n      // Executes whenever the \"value\" property changes\n      // See the addObserver method for more information about the callback arguments\n    })\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Although this is the most common way to add an observer, this capability\n  is actually built into the `EmberObject` class on top of two methods\n  defined in this mixin: `addObserver` and `removeObserver`. You can use\n  these two methods to add and remove observers yourself if you need to\n  do so at runtime.\n\n  To add an observer for a property, call:\n\n  ```javascript\n  object.addObserver('propertyKey', targetObject, targetAction)\n  ```\n\n  This will call the `targetAction` method on the `targetObject` whenever\n  the value of the `propertyKey` changes.\n\n  Note that if `propertyKey` is a computed property, the observer will be\n  called when any of the property dependencies are changed, even if the\n  resulting value of the computed property is unchanged. This is necessary\n  because computed properties are not computed until `get` is called.\n\n  @class Observable\n  @public\n*/\ninterface Observable {\n  /**\n    Retrieves the value of a property from the object.\n\n    This method is usually similar to using `object[keyName]` or `object.keyName`,\n    however it supports both computed properties and the unknownProperty\n    handler.\n\n    Because `get` unifies the syntax for accessing all these kinds\n    of properties, it can make many refactorings easier, such as replacing a\n    simple property with a computed property, or vice versa.\n\n    ### Computed Properties\n\n    Computed properties are methods defined with the `property` modifier\n    declared at the end, such as:\n\n    ```javascript\n    import { computed } from '@ember/object';\n\n    fullName: computed('firstName', 'lastName', function() {\n      return this.get('firstName') + ' ' + this.get('lastName');\n    })\n    ```\n\n    When you call `get` on a computed property, the function will be\n    called and the return value will be returned instead of the function\n    itself.\n\n    ### Unknown Properties\n\n    Likewise, if you try to call `get` on a property whose value is\n    `undefined`, the `unknownProperty()` method will be called on the object.\n    If this method returns any value other than `undefined`, it will be returned\n    instead. This allows you to implement \"virtual\" properties that are\n    not defined upfront.\n\n    @method get\n    @param {String} keyName The property to retrieve\n    @return {Object} The property value or undefined.\n    @public\n  */\n  get<K extends keyof this>(key: K): this[K];\n  get(key: string): unknown;\n\n  /**\n    To get the values of multiple properties at once, call `getProperties`\n    with a list of strings or an array:\n\n    ```javascript\n    record.getProperties('firstName', 'lastName', 'zipCode');\n    // { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', zipCode: '10011' }\n    ```\n\n    is equivalent to:\n\n    ```javascript\n    record.getProperties(['firstName', 'lastName', 'zipCode']);\n    // { firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe', zipCode: '10011' }\n    ```\n\n    @method getProperties\n    @param {String...|Array} list of keys to get\n    @return {Object}\n    @public\n  */\n  getProperties<L extends Array<keyof this>>(list: L): { [Key in L[number]]: this[Key] };\n  getProperties<L extends Array<keyof this>>(...list: L): { [Key in L[number]]: this[Key] };\n  getProperties<L extends string[]>(list: L): { [Key in L[number]]: unknown };\n  getProperties<L extends string[]>(...list: L): { [Key in L[number]]: unknown };\n\n  // NOT TYPE SAFE!\n  /**\n    Sets the provided key or path to the value.\n\n    ```javascript\n    record.set(\"key\", value);\n    ```\n\n    This method is generally very similar to calling `object[\"key\"] = value` or\n    `object.key = value`, except that it provides support for computed\n    properties, the `setUnknownProperty()` method and property observers.\n\n    ### Computed Properties\n\n    If you try to set a value on a key that has a computed property handler\n    defined (see the `get()` method for an example), then `set()` will call\n    that method, passing both the value and key instead of simply changing\n    the value itself. This is useful for those times when you need to\n    implement a property that is composed of one or more member\n    properties.\n\n    ### Unknown Properties\n\n    If you try to set a value on a key that is undefined in the target\n    object, then the `setUnknownProperty()` handler will be called instead. This\n    gives you an opportunity to implement complex \"virtual\" properties that\n    are not predefined on the object. If `setUnknownProperty()` returns\n    undefined, then `set()` will simply set the value on the object.\n\n    ### Property Observers\n\n    In addition to changing the property, `set()` will also register a property\n    change with the object. Unless you have placed this call inside of a\n    `beginPropertyChanges()` and `endPropertyChanges(),` any \"local\" observers\n    (i.e. observer methods declared on the same object), will be called\n    immediately. Any \"remote\" observers (i.e. observer methods declared on\n    another object) will be placed in a queue and called at a later time in a\n    coalesced manner.\n\n    @method set\n    @param {String} keyName The property to set\n    @param {Object} value The value to set or `null`.\n    @return {Object} The passed value\n    @public\n  */\n  set<K extends keyof this, T extends this[K]>(key: K, value: T): T;\n  set<T>(key: string, value: T): T;\n\n  // NOT TYPE SAFE!\n  /**\n    Sets a list of properties at once. These properties are set inside\n    a single `beginPropertyChanges` and `endPropertyChanges` batch, so\n    observers will be buffered.\n\n    ```javascript\n    record.setProperties({ firstName: 'Charles', lastName: 'Jolley' });\n    ```\n\n    @method setProperties\n    @param {Object} hash the hash of keys and values to set\n    @return {Object} The passed in hash\n    @public\n  */\n  setProperties<K extends keyof this, P extends { [Key in K]: this[Key] }>(hash: P): P;\n  setProperties<T extends Record<string, unknown>>(hash: T): T;\n\n  /**\n    Convenience method to call `propertyWillChange` and `propertyDidChange` in\n    succession.\n\n    Notify the observer system that a property has just changed.\n\n    Sometimes you need to change a value directly or indirectly without\n    actually calling `get()` or `set()` on it. In this case, you can use this\n    method instead. Calling this method will notify all observers that the\n    property has potentially changed value.\n\n    @method notifyPropertyChange\n    @param {String} keyName The property key to be notified about.\n    @return {Observable}\n    @public\n  */\n  notifyPropertyChange(keyName: string): this;\n\n  /**\n    Adds an observer on a property.\n\n    This is the core method used to register an observer for a property.\n\n    Once you call this method, any time the key's value is set, your observer\n    will be notified. Note that the observers are triggered any time the\n    value is set, regardless of whether it has actually changed. Your\n    observer should be prepared to handle that.\n\n    There are two common invocation patterns for `.addObserver()`:\n\n    - Passing two arguments:\n      - the name of the property to observe (as a string)\n      - the function to invoke (an actual function)\n    - Passing three arguments:\n      - the name of the property to observe (as a string)\n      - the target object (will be used to look up and invoke a\n        function on)\n      - the name of the function to invoke on the target object\n        (as a string).\n\n    ```app/components/my-component.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n\n    export default Component.extend({\n      init() {\n        this._super(...arguments);\n\n        // the following are equivalent:\n\n        // using three arguments\n        this.addObserver('foo', this, 'fooDidChange');\n\n        // using two arguments\n        this.addObserver('foo', (...args) => {\n          this.fooDidChange(...args);\n        });\n      },\n\n      fooDidChange() {\n        // your custom logic code\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n\n    ### Observer Methods\n\n    Observer methods have the following signature:\n\n    ```app/components/my-component.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n\n    export default Component.extend({\n      init() {\n        this._super(...arguments);\n        this.addObserver('foo', this, 'fooDidChange');\n      },\n\n      fooDidChange(sender, key, value, rev) {\n        // your code\n      }\n    });\n    ```\n\n    The `sender` is the object that changed. The `key` is the property that\n    changes. The `value` property is currently reserved and unused. The `rev`\n    is the last property revision of the object when it changed, which you can\n    use to detect if the key value has really changed or not.\n\n    Usually you will not need the value or revision parameters at\n    the end. In this case, it is common to write observer methods that take\n    only a sender and key value as parameters or, if you aren't interested in\n    any of these values, to write an observer that has no parameters at all.\n\n    @method addObserver\n    @param {String} key The key to observe\n    @param {Object} target The target object to invoke\n    @param {String|Function} method The method to invoke\n    @param {Boolean} sync Whether the observer is sync or not\n    @return {Observable}\n    @public\n  */\n  addObserver<Target>(key: keyof this, target: Target, method: ObserverMethod<Target, this>): this;\n  addObserver(key: keyof this, method: ObserverMethod<this, this>): this;\n\n  /**\n    Remove an observer you have previously registered on this object.

If the user changes the text, the value of `this.searchWord` will also be\n  updated.\n\n  ### Actions\n\n  The `Input` component takes a number of arguments with callbacks that are invoked in response to\n  user events.\n\n  * `enter`\n  * `insert-newline`\n  * `escape-press`\n  * `focus-in`\n  * `focus-out`\n  * `key-down`\n  * `key-press`\n  * `key-up`\n\n  These callbacks are passed to `Input` like this:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <Input @value={{this.searchWord}} @enter={{this.query}} />\n  ```\n\n  Starting with Ember Octane, we recommend using the `{{on}}` modifier to call actions\n  on specific events, such as the input event.\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <label for=\"input-name\">Name:</label>\n  <Input\n    @id=\"input-name\"\n    @value={{this.name}}\n    {{on \"input\" this.validateName}}\n  />\n  ```\n\n  The event name (e.g. `focusout`, `input`, `keydown`) always follows the casing\n  that the HTML standard uses.\n\n  ### `<input>` HTML Attributes to Avoid\n\n  In most cases, if you want to pass an attribute to the underlying HTML `<input>` element, you\n  can pass the attribute directly, just like any other Ember component.\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <Input @type=\"text\" size=\"10\" />\n  ```\n\n  In this example, the `size` attribute will be applied to the underlying `<input>` element in the\n  outputted HTML.\n\n  However, there are a few attributes where you **must** use the `@` version.\n\n  * `@type`: This argument is used to control which Ember component is used under the hood\n  * `@value`: The `@value` argument installs a two-way binding onto the element. If you wanted a\n    one-way binding, use `<input>` with the `value` property and the `input` event instead.\n  * `@checked` (for checkboxes): like `@value`, the `@checked` argument installs a two-way binding\n    onto the element. If you wanted a one-way binding, use `<input type=\"checkbox\">` with\n    `checked` and the `input` event instead.\n\n  ### Checkbox\n\n  To create an `<input type=\"checkbox\">`:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  Emberize Everything:\n  <Input @type=\"checkbox\" @checked={{this.isEmberized}} name=\"isEmberized\" />\n  ```\n\n  This will bind the checked state of this checkbox to the value of `isEmberized` -- if either one\n  changes, it will be reflected in the other.\n\n  @method Input\n  @for Ember.Templates.components\n  @param {Hash} options\n  @public\n*/\nclass _Input extends AbstractInput {\n  static toString(): string {\n    return 'Input';\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * The HTML class attribute.\n   */\n  get class(): string {\n    if (this.isCheckbox) {\n      return 'ember-checkbox ember-view';\n    } else {\n      return 'ember-text-field ember-view';\n    }\n  }\n\n  /**\n   * The HTML type attribute.\n   */\n  get type(): string {\n    let type = this.named('type');\n\n    if (type === null || type === undefined) {\n      return 'text';\n    }\n\n    assert(\n      'The `@type` argument to the <Input> component must be a string',\n      typeof type === 'string'\n    );\n\n    return isValidInputType(type) ? type : 'text';\n  }\n\n  get isCheckbox(): boolean {\n    return this.named('type') === 'checkbox';\n  }\n\n  private _checked = valueFrom(this.args.named['checked']);\n\n  get checked(): unknown {\n    if (this.isCheckbox) {\n      warn(\n        '`<Input @type=\"checkbox\" />` reflects its checked state via the `@checked` argument.

The block for `LinkTo`\n  becomes the contents of the rendered element:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery'>\n    Great Hamster Photos\n  </LinkTo>\n  ```\n\n  This will result in:\n\n  ```html\n  <a href=\"/hamster-photos\">\n    Great Hamster Photos\n  </a>\n  ```\n\n  ### Disabling the `LinkTo` component\n\n  The `LinkTo` component can be disabled by using the `disabled` argument. A disabled link\n  doesn't result in a transition when activated, and adds the `disabled` class to the `<a>`\n  element.\n\n  (The class name to apply to the element can be overridden by using the `disabledClass`\n  argument)\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @disabled={{true}}>\n    Great Hamster Photos\n  </LinkTo>\n  ```\n\n  ### Handling `href`\n\n  `<LinkTo>` will use your application's Router to fill the element's `href` property with a URL\n  that matches the path to the supplied `routeName`.\n\n  ### Handling current route\n\n  The `LinkTo` component will apply a CSS class name of 'active' when the application's current\n  route matches the supplied routeName. For example, if the application's current route is\n  'photoGallery.recent', then the following invocation of `LinkTo`:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery.recent'>\n    Great Hamster Photos\n  </LinkTo>\n  ```\n\n  will result in\n\n  ```html\n  <a href=\"/hamster-photos/this-week\" class=\"active\">\n    Great Hamster Photos\n  </a>\n  ```\n\n  The CSS class used for active classes can be customized by passing an `activeClass` argument:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery.recent' @activeClass=\"current-url\">\n    Great Hamster Photos\n  </LinkTo>\n  ```\n\n  ```html\n  <a href=\"/hamster-photos/this-week\" class=\"current-url\">\n    Great Hamster Photos\n  </a>\n  ```\n\n  ### Keeping a link active for other routes\n\n  If you need a link to be 'active' even when it doesn't match the current route, you can use the\n  `current-when` argument.\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @current-when='photos'>\n    Photo Gallery\n  </LinkTo>\n  ```\n\n  This may be helpful for keeping links active for:\n\n  * non-nested routes that are logically related\n  * some secondary menu approaches\n  * 'top navigation' with 'sub navigation' scenarios\n\n  A link will be active if `current-when` is `true` or the current\n  route is the route this link would transition to.\n\n  To match multiple routes 'space-separate' the routes:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <LinkTo @route='gallery' @current-when='photos drawings paintings'>\n    Art Gallery\n  </LinkTo>\n  ```\n\n  ### Supplying a model\n\n  An optional `model` argument can be used for routes whose\n  paths contain dynamic segments. This argument will become\n  the model context of the linked route:\n\n  ```javascript\n  Router.map(function() {\n    this.route(\"photoGallery\", {path: \"hamster-photos/:photo_id\"});\n  });\n  ```\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @model={{this.aPhoto}}>\n    {{aPhoto.title}}\n  </LinkTo>\n  ```\n\n  ```html\n  <a href=\"/hamster-photos/42\">\n    Tomster\n  </a>\n  ```\n\n  ### Supplying multiple models\n\n  For deep-linking to route paths that contain multiple\n  dynamic segments, the `models` argument can be used.\n\n  As the router transitions through the route path, each\n  supplied model argument will become the context for the\n  route with the dynamic segments:\n\n  ```javascript\n  Router.map(function() {\n    this.route(\"photoGallery\", { path: \"hamster-photos/:photo_id\" }, function() {\n      this.route(\"comment\", {path: \"comments/:comment_id\"});\n    });\n  });\n  ```\n\n  This argument will become the model context of the linked route:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery.comment' @models={{array this.aPhoto this.comment}}>\n    {{comment.body}}\n  </LinkTo>\n  ```\n\n  ```html\n  <a href=\"/hamster-photos/42/comments/718\">\n    A+++ would snuggle again.\n  </a>\n  ```\n\n  ### Supplying an explicit dynamic segment value\n\n  If you don't have a model object available to pass to `LinkTo`,\n  an optional string or integer argument can be passed for routes whose\n  paths contain dynamic segments. This argument will become the value\n  of the dynamic segment:\n\n  ```javascript\n  Router.map(function() {\n    this.route(\"photoGallery\", { path: \"hamster-photos/:photo_id\" });\n  });\n  ```\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @model={{aPhotoId}}>\n    {{this.aPhoto.title}}\n  </LinkTo>\n  ```\n\n  ```html\n  <a href=\"/hamster-photos/42\">\n    Tomster\n  </a>\n  ```\n\n  When transitioning into the linked route, the `model` hook will\n  be triggered with parameters including this passed identifier.\n\n  ### Supplying query parameters\n\n  If you need to add optional key-value pairs that appear to the right of the ? in a URL,\n  you can use the `query` argument.\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <LinkTo @route='photoGallery' @query={{hash page=1 per_page=20}}>\n    Great Hamster Photos\n  </LinkTo>\n  ```\n\n  This will result in:\n\n  ```html\n  <a href=\"/hamster-photos?page=1&per_page=20\">\n    Great Hamster Photos\n  </a>\n  ```\n\n  @for Ember.Templates.components\n  @method LinkTo\n  @public\n*/\n\n/**\n  @module @ember/routing\n*/\n\n/**\n  See [Ember.Templates.components.LinkTo](/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.components/methods/input?anchor=LinkTo).\n\n  @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n  @method link-to\n  @see {Ember.Templates.components.LinkTo}\n  @public\n**/\n\n/**\n  An opaque interface which can be imported and used in strict-mode\n  templates to call <LinkTo>.\n\n  See [Ember.Templates.components.LinkTo](/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.components/methods/input?anchor=LinkTo).\n\n  @for @ember/routing\n  @method LinkTo\n  @see {Ember.Templates.components.LinkTo}\n  @public\n**/\n\nclass _LinkTo extends InternalComponent {\n  static toString(): string {\n    return 'LinkTo';\n  }\n\n  @service('-routing') declare private routing: RoutingService<Route>;\n\n  validateArguments(): void {\n    assert(\n      'You attempted to use the <LinkTo> component within a routeless engine, this is not supported.

If the user types text into the textarea, the `@value`\n  argument is updated. If the `@value` argument is updated, the text in the textarea is updated.\n\n  In the following example, the `writtenWords` property on the component will be updated as the user\n  types 'Lots of text' into the text area of their browser's window.\n\n  ```app/components/word-editor.js\n  import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n  import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';\n\n  export default class WordEditorComponent extends Component {\n    @tracked writtenWords = \"Lots of text that IS bound\";\n  }\n  ```\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <Textarea @value={{writtenWords}} />\n  ```\n\n  Would result in the following HTML:\n\n  ```html\n  <textarea class=\"ember-text-area\">\n    Lots of text that IS bound\n  </textarea>\n  ```\n\n  If you wanted a one way binding, you could use the `<textarea>` element directly, and use the\n  `value` DOM property and the `input` event.\n\n  ### Actions\n\n  The `Textarea` component takes a number of arguments with callbacks that are invoked in\n  response to user events.\n\n  * `enter`\n  * `insert-newline`\n  * `escape-press`\n  * `focus-in`\n  * `focus-out`\n  * `key-press`\n\n  These callbacks are passed to `Textarea` like this:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <Textarea @value={{this.searchWord}} @enter={{this.query}} />\n  ```\n\n  ## Classic Invocation Syntax\n\n  The `Textarea` component can also be invoked using curly braces, just like any other Ember\n  component.\n\n  For example, this is an invocation using angle-bracket notation:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <Textarea @value={{this.searchWord}} @enter={{this.query}} />\n  ```\n\n  You could accomplish the same thing using classic invocation:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{textarea value=this.searchWord enter=this.query}}\n  ```\n\n  The main difference is that angle-bracket invocation supports any HTML attribute using HTML\n  attribute syntax, because attributes and arguments have different syntax when using angle-bracket\n  invocation. Curly brace invocation, on the other hand, only has a single syntax for arguments,\n  and components must manually map attributes onto component arguments.\n\n  When using classic invocation with `{{textarea}}`, only the following attributes are mapped onto\n  arguments:\n\n  * rows\n  * cols\n  * name\n  * selectionEnd\n  * selectionStart\n  * autocomplete\n  * wrap\n  * lang\n  * dir\n  * value\n\n  ## Classic `layout` and `layoutName` properties\n\n  Because HTML `textarea` elements do not contain inner HTML the `layout` and\n  `layoutName` properties will not be applied.\n\n  @method

(usually\n  just a function) between components, and into components from controllers.\n\n  ### Passing functions with the action helper\n\n  There are three contexts an action helper can be used in. The first two\n  contexts to discuss are attribute context, and Handlebars value context.\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{! An example of attribute context }}\n  <div onclick={{action \"save\"}}></div>\n  {{! Examples of Handlebars value context }}\n  {{input on-input=(action \"save\")}}\n  {{yield (action \"refreshData\") andAnotherParam}}\n  ```\n\n  In these contexts,\n  the helper is called a \"closure action\" helper. Its behavior is simple:\n  If passed a function name, read that function off the `actions` property\n  of the current context. Once that function is read, or immediately if a function was\n  passed, create a closure over that function and any arguments.\n  The resulting value of an action helper used this way is simply a function.\n\n  For example, in the attribute context:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{! An example of attribute context }}\n  <div onclick={{action \"save\"}}></div>\n  ```\n\n  The resulting template render logic would be:\n\n  ```js\n  var div = document.createElement('div');\n  var actionFunction = (function(context){\n    return function() {\n      return context.actions.save.apply(context, arguments);\n    };\n  })(context);\n  div.onclick = actionFunction;\n  ```\n\n  Thus when the div is clicked, the action on that context is called.\n  Because the `actionFunction` is just a function, closure actions can be\n  passed between components and still execute in the correct context.\n\n  Here is an example action handler on a component:\n\n  ```app/components/my-component.js\n  import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n  import { action } from '@ember/object';\n\n  export default class extends Component {\n    @action\n    save() {\n      this.model.save();\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Actions are always looked up on the `actions` property of the current context.\n  This avoids collisions in the naming of common actions, such as `destroy`.\n  Two options can be passed to the `action` helper when it is used in this way.\n\n  * `target=someProperty` will look to `someProperty` instead of the current\n    context for the `actions` hash. This can be useful when targeting a\n    service for actions.\n  * `value=\"target.value\"` will read the path `target.value` off the first\n    argument to the action when it is called and rewrite the first argument\n    to be that value. This is useful when attaching actions to event listeners.\n\n  ### Invoking an action\n\n  Closure actions curry both their scope and any arguments. When invoked, any\n  additional arguments are added to the already curried list.\n  Actions are presented in JavaScript as callbacks, and are\n  invoked like any other JavaScript function.\n\n  For example\n\n  ```app/components/update-name.js\n  import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n  import { action } from '@ember/object';\n\n  export default class extends Component {\n    @action\n    setName(model, name) {\n      model.set('name', name);\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  ```app/components/update-name.hbs\n  {{input on-input=(action (action 'setName' @model) value=\"target.value\")}}\n  ```\n\n  The first argument (`@model`) was curried over, and the run-time argument (`event`)\n  becomes a second argument. Action calls can be nested this way because each simply\n  returns a function. Any function can be passed to the `{{action}}` helper, including\n  other actions.\n\n  Actions invoked with `sendAction` have the same currying behavior as demonstrated\n  with `on-input` above. For example:\n\n  ```app/components/my-input.js\n  import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n  import { action } from '@ember/object';\n\n  export default class extends Component {\n    @action\n    setName(model, name) {\n      model.set('name', name);\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <MyInput @submit={{action 'setName' @model}} />\n  ```\n\n  or\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{my-input submit=(action 'setName' @model)}}\n  ```\n\n  ```app/components/my-component.js\n  import Component from '@ember/component';\n\n  export default Component.extend({\n    click() {\n      // Note that model is not passed, it was curried in the template\n      this.submit('bob');\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n\n  ### Attaching actions to DOM elements\n\n  The third context of the `{{action}}` helper can be called \"element space\".\n  For example:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{! An example of element space }}\n  <div {{action \"save\"}}></div>\n  ```\n\n  Used this way, the `{{action}}` helper provides a useful shortcut for\n  registering an HTML element in a template for a single DOM event and\n  forwarding that interaction to the template's context (controller or component).\n  If the context of a template is a controller, actions used this way will\n  bubble to routes when the controller does not implement the specified action.\n  Once an action hits a route, it will bubble through the route hierarchy.\n\n  ### Event Propagation\n\n  `{{action}}` helpers called in element space can control event bubbling. Note\n  that the closure style actions cannot.\n\n  Events triggered through the action helper will automatically have\n  `.preventDefault()` called on them. You do not need to do so in your event\n  handlers. If you need to allow event propagation (to handle file inputs for\n  example) you can supply the `preventDefault=false` option to the `{{action}}` helper:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <div {{action \"sayHello\" preventDefault=false}}>\n    <input type=\"file\" />\n    <input type=\"checkbox\" />\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  To disable bubbling, pass `bubbles=false` to the helper:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <button {{action 'edit' post bubbles=false}}>Edit</button>\n  ```\n\n  To disable bubbling with closure style actions you must create your own\n  wrapper helper that makes use of `event.stopPropagation()`:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <div onclick={{disable-bubbling (action \"sayHello\")}}>Hello</div>\n  ```\n\n  ```app/helpers/disable-bubbling.js\n  import { helper } from '@ember/component/helper';\n\n  export function disableBubbling([action]) {\n    return function(event) {\n      event.stopPropagation();\n      return action(event);\n    };\n  }\n  export default helper(disableBubbling);\n  ```\n\n  If you need the default handler to trigger you should either register your\n  own event handler, or use event methods on your view class. See\n  [\"Responding to Browser Events\"](/ember/release/classes/Component)\n  in the documentation for `Component` for more information.\n\n  ### Specifying DOM event type\n\n  `{{action}}` helpers called in element space can specify an event type.\n  By default the `{{action}}` helper registers for DOM `click` events. You can\n  supply an `on` option to the helper to specify a different DOM event name:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <div {{action \"anActionName\" on=\"doubleClick\"}}>\n    click me\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  See [\"Event Names\"](/ember/release/classes/Component) for a list of\n  acceptable DOM event names.\n\n  ### Specifying whitelisted modifier keys\n\n  `{{action}}` helpers called in element space can specify modifier keys.\n  By default the `{{action}}` helper will ignore click events with pressed modifier\n  keys. You can supply an `allowedKeys` option to specify which keys should not be ignored.\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <div {{action \"anActionName\" allowedKeys=\"alt\"}}>\n    click me\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  This way the action will fire when clicking with the alt key pressed down.\n  Alternatively, supply \"any\" to the `allowedKeys` option to accept any combination of modifier keys.\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <div {{action \"anActionName\" allowedKeys=\"any\"}}>\n    click me with any key pressed\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  ### Specifying a Target\n\n  A `target` option can be provided to the helper to change\n  which object will receive the method call. This option must be a path\n  to an object, accessible in the current context:\n\n  ```app/templates/application.hbs\n  <div {{action \"anActionName\" target=someService}}>\n    click me\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  ```app/controllers/application.js\n  import Controller from '@ember/controller';\n  import { service } from '@ember/service';\n\n  export default class extends Controller {\n    @service someService;\n  }\n  ```\n\n  @method action\n  @deprecated\n  @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n  @public\n*/\nexport default internalHelper((args: CapturedArguments): Reference<Function> => {\n  deprecateUntil(\n    `Usage of the \\`(action)\\` helper is deprecated.

These\n    are called Template-only or TO components.\n  - Components _with_ JavaScript, which consist of a template and a backing\n    class.\n\n  Ember ships with two types of JavaScript classes for components:\n\n  1. Glimmer components, imported from `@glimmer/component`, which are the\n     default component's for Ember Octane (3.15) and more recent editions.\n  2. Classic components, imported from `@ember/component`, which were the\n     default for older editions of Ember (pre 3.15).\n\n  Below is the documentation for Classic components. If you are looking for the\n  API documentation for Template-only or Glimmer components, it is [available\n  here](/ember/release/modules/@glimmer%2Fcomponent).\n\n  ## Defining a Classic Component\n\n  If you want to customize the component in order to handle events, transform\n  arguments or maintain internal state, you implement a subclass of `Component`.\n\n  One example is to add computed properties to your component:\n\n  ```app/components/person-profile.js\n  import Component from '@ember/component';\n\n  export default Component.extend({\n    displayName: computed('person.title', 'person.firstName', 'person.lastName', function() {\n      let { title, firstName, lastName } = this.person;\n\n      if (title) {\n        return `${title} ${lastName}`;\n      } else {\n        return `${firstName} ${lastName}`;\n      }\n    })\n  });\n  ```\n\n  And then use it in the component's template:\n\n  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n  <h1>{{this.displayName}}</h1>\n  {{yield}}\n  ```\n\n  ## Customizing a Classic Component's HTML Element in JavaScript\n\n  ### HTML Tag\n\n  The default HTML tag name used for a component's HTML representation is `div`.\n  This can be customized by setting the `tagName` property.\n\n  Consider the following component class:\n\n  ```app/components/emphasized-paragraph.js\n  import Component from '@ember/component';\n\n  export default Component.extend({\n    tagName: 'em'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  When invoked, this component would produce output that looks something like\n  this:\n\n  ```html\n  <em id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\"></em>\n  ```\n\n  ### HTML `class` Attribute\n\n  The HTML `class` attribute of a component's tag can be set by providing a\n  `classNames` property that is set to an array of strings:\n\n  ```app/components/my-widget.js\n  import Component from '@ember/component';\n\n  export default Component.extend({\n    classNames: ['my-class', 'my-other-class']\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Invoking this component will produce output that looks like this:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view my-class my-other-class\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  `class` attribute values can also be set by providing a `classNameBindings`\n  property set to an array of properties names for the component. The return\n  value of these properties will be added as part of the value for the\n  components's `class` attribute. These properties can be computed properties:\n\n  ```app/components/my-widget.js\n  import Component from '@ember/component';\n  import { computed } from '@ember/object';\n\n  export default Component.extend({\n    classNames: ['my-class', 'my-other-class'],\n    classNameBindings: ['propertyA', 'propertyB'],\n\n    propertyA: 'from-a',\n    propertyB: computed(function() {\n      if (someLogic) { return 'from-b'; }\n    })\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view my-class my-other-class from-a from-b\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  Note that `classNames` and `classNameBindings` is in addition to the `class`\n  attribute passed with the angle bracket invocation syntax. Therefore, if this\n  component was invoked like so:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <MyWidget class=\"from-invocation\" />\n  ```\n\n  The resulting HTML will look similar to this:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"from-invocation ember-view my-class my-other-class from-a from-b\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  If the value of a class name binding returns a boolean the property name\n  itself will be used as the class name if the property is true. The class name\n  will not be added if the value is `false` or `undefined`.\n\n  ```app/components/my-widget.js\n  import Component from '@ember/component';\n\n  export default Component.extend({\n    classNameBindings: ['hovered'],\n\n    hovered: true\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view hovered\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  ### Custom Class Names for Boolean Values\n\n  When using boolean class name bindings you can supply a string value other\n  than the property name for use as the `class` HTML attribute by appending the\n  preferred value after a \":\" character when defining the binding:\n\n  ```app/components/my-widget.js\n  import Component from '@ember/component';\n\n  export default Component.extend({\n    classNameBindings: ['awesome:so-very-cool'],\n\n    awesome: true\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view so-very-cool\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  Boolean value class name bindings whose property names are in a\n  camelCase-style format will be converted to a dasherized format:\n\n  ```app/components/my-widget.js\n  import Component from '@ember/component';\n\n  export default Component.extend({\n    classNameBindings: ['isUrgent'],\n\n    isUrgent: true\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view is-urgent\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  Class name bindings can also refer to object values that are found by\n  traversing a path relative to the component itself:\n\n  ```app/components/my-widget.js\n  import Component from '@ember/component';\n  import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n\n  export default Component.extend({\n    classNameBindings: ['messages.empty'],\n\n    messages: EmberObject.create({\n      empty: true\n    })\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view empty\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  If you want to add a class name for a property which evaluates to true and and\n  a different class name if it evaluates to false, you can pass a binding like\n  this:\n\n  ```app/components/my-widget.js\n  import Component from '@ember/component';\n\n  export default Component.extend({\n    classNameBindings: ['isEnabled:enabled:disabled'],\n    isEnabled: true\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view enabled\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  When isEnabled is `false`, the resulting HTML representation looks like this:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view disabled\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  This syntax offers the convenience to add a class if a property is `false`:\n\n  ```app/components/my-widget.js\n  import Component from '@ember/component';\n\n  // Applies no class when isEnabled is true and class 'disabled' when isEnabled is false\n  export default Component.extend({\n    classNameBindings: ['isEnabled::disabled'],\n    isEnabled: true\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Invoking this component when the `isEnabled` property is true will produce\n  HTML that looks like:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  Invoking it when the `isEnabled` property on the component is `false` will\n  produce HTML that looks like:\n\n  ```html\n  <div id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view disabled\"></div>\n  ```\n\n  Updates to the value of a class name binding will result in automatic update\n  of the  HTML `class` attribute in the component's rendered HTML\n  representation. If the value becomes `false` or `undefined` the class name\n  will be removed.\n\n  Both `classNames` and `classNameBindings` are concatenated properties. See\n  [EmberObject](/ember/release/classes/EmberObject) documentation for more\n  information about concatenated properties.\n\n  ### Other HTML Attributes\n\n  The HTML attribute section of a component's tag can be set by providing an\n  `attributeBindings` property set to an array of property names on the\n  component. The return value of these properties will be used as the value of\n  the component's HTML associated attribute:\n\n  ```app/components/my-anchor.js\n  import Component from '@ember/component';\n\n  export default Component.extend({\n    tagName: 'a',\n    attributeBindings: ['href'],\n\n    href: 'http://google.com'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n\n  ```html\n  <a id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" href=\"http://google.com\"></a>\n  ```\n\n  One property can be mapped on to another by placing a \":\" between the source\n  property and the destination property:\n\n  ```app/components/my-anchor.js\n  import Component from '@ember/component';\n\n  export default Component.extend({\n    tagName: 'a',\n    attributeBindings: ['url:href'],\n\n    url: 'http://google.com'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n\n  ```html\n  <a id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" href=\"http://google.com\"></a>\n  ```\n\n  HTML attributes passed with angle bracket invocations will take precedence\n  over those specified in `attributeBindings`. Therefore, if this component was\n  invoked like so:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <MyAnchor href=\"http://bing.com\" @url=\"http://google.com\" />\n  ```\n\n  The resulting HTML will looks like this:\n\n  ```html\n  <a id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" href=\"http://bing.com\"></a>\n  ```\n\n  Note that the `href` attribute is ultimately set to `http://bing.com`, despite\n  it having attribute binidng to the `url` property, which was set to\n  `http://google.com`.\n\n  Namespaced attributes (e.g. `xlink:href`) are supported, but have to be\n  mapped, since `:` is not a valid character for properties in Javascript:\n\n  ```app/components/my-use.js\n  import Component from '@ember/component';\n\n  export default Component.extend({\n    tagName: 'use',\n    attributeBindings: ['xlinkHref:xlink:href'],\n\n    xlinkHref: '#triangle'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n\n  ```html\n  <use xlink:href=\"#triangle\"></use>\n  ```\n\n  If the value of a property monitored by `attributeBindings` is a boolean, the\n  attribute will be present or absent depending on the value:\n\n  ```app/components/my-text-input.js\n  import Component from '@ember/component';\n\n  export default Component.extend({\n    tagName: 'input',\n    attributeBindings: ['disabled'],\n\n    disabled: false\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Invoking this component will produce HTML that looks like:\n\n  ```html\n  <input id=\"ember1\" class=\"ember-view\" />\n  ```\n\n  `attributeBindings` can refer to computed properties:\n\n  ```app/components/my-text-input.js\n  import Component from '@ember/component';\n  import { computed } from '@ember/object';\n\n  export default Component.extend({\n    tagName: 'input',\n    attributeBindings: ['disabled'],\n\n    disabled: computed(function() {\n      if (someLogic) {\n        return true;\n      } else {\n        return false;\n      }\n    })\n  });\n  ```\n\n  To prevent setting an attribute altogether, use `null` or `undefined` as the\n  value of the property used in `attributeBindings`:\n\n  ```app/components/my-text-input.js\n  import Component from '@ember/component';\n\n  export default Component.extend({\n    tagName: 'form',\n    attributeBindings: ['novalidate'],\n    novalidate: null\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Updates to the property of an attribute binding will result in automatic\n  update of the  HTML attribute in the component's HTML output.\n\n  `attributeBindings` is a concatenated property. See\n  [EmberObject](/ember/release/classes/EmberObject) documentation for more\n  information about concatenated properties.\n\n  ## Layouts\n\n  The `layout` property can be used to dynamically specify a template associated\n  with a component class, instead of relying on Ember to link together a\n  component class and a template based on file names.\n\n  In general, applications should not use this feature, but it's commonly used\n  in addons for historical reasons.\n\n  The `layout` property should be set to the default export of a template\n  module, which is the name of a template file without the `.hbs` extension.\n\n  ```app/templates/components/person-profile.hbs\n  <h1>Person's Title</h1>\n  <div class='details'>{{yield}}</div>\n  ```\n\n  ```app/components/person-profile.js\n    import Component from '@ember/component';\n    import layout from '../templates/components/person-profile';\n\n    export default Component.extend({\n      layout\n    });\n  ```\n\n  If you invoke the component:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <PersonProfile>\n    <h2>Chief Basket Weaver</h2>\n    <h3>Fisherman Industries</h3>\n  </PersonProfile>\n  ```\n\n  or\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{#person-profile}}\n    <h2>Chief Basket Weaver</h2>\n    <h3>Fisherman Industries</h3>\n  {{/person-profile}}\n  ```\n\n  It will result in the following HTML output:\n\n  ```html\n  <h1>Person's Title</h1>\n    <div class=\"details\">\n    <h2>Chief Basket Weaver</h2>\n    <h3>Fisherman Industries</h3>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  ## Handling Browser Events\n\n  There are two ways to handle user-initiated events:\n\n  ### Using the `on` modifier to capture browser events\n\n  In a component's template, you can attach an event handler to any element with the `on` modifier:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <button {{on 'click' this.doSomething}} />\n  ```\n\n  This will call the function on your component:\n\n  ```js\n  import Component from '@ember/component';\n\n  export default class ExampleComponent extends Component {\n    doSomething = (event) => {\n      // `event` is the native click Event\n      console.log('clicked on the button');\n    };\n  });\n  ```\n\n  See the [Guide on Component event\n  handlers](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/components/component-state-and-actions/#toc_html-modifiers-and-actions)\n  and the [API docs for `on`](../Ember.Templates.helpers/methods/on?anchor=on)\n  for more details.\n\n  ### Event Handler Methods\n\n  Components can also respond to user-initiated events by implementing a method\n  that matches the event name. This approach is appropriate when the same event\n  should be handled by all instances of the same component.\n\n  An event object will be passed as the argument to the event handler method.\n\n  ```app/components/my-widget.js\n  import Component from '@ember/component';\n\n  export default Component.extend({\n    click(event) {\n      // `event.target` is either the component's element or one of its children\n      let tag = event.target.tagName.toLowerCase();\n      console.log('clicked on a `<${tag}>` HTML element!');\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n\n  In this example, whenever the user clicked anywhere inside the component, it\n  will log a message to the console.\n\n  It is possible to handle event types other than `click` by implementing the\n  following event handler methods. In addition, custom events can be registered\n  by using `Application.customEvents`.\n\n  Touch events:\n\n  * `touchStart`\n  * `touchMove`\n  * `touchEnd`\n  * `touchCancel`\n\n  Keyboard events:\n\n  * `keyDown`\n  * `keyUp`\n  * `keyPress`\n\n  Mouse events:\n\n  * `mouseDown`\n  * `mouseUp`\n  * `contextMenu`\n  * `click`\n  * `doubleClick`\n  * `focusIn`\n  * `focusOut`\n\n  Form events:\n\n  * `submit`\n  * `change`\n  * `focusIn`\n  * `focusOut`\n  * `input`\n\n  Drag and drop events:\n\n  * `dragStart`\n  * `drag`\n  * `dragEnter`\n  * `dragLeave`\n  * `dragOver`\n  * `dragEnd`\n  * `drop`\n\n  @class Component\n  @extends Ember.CoreView\n  @uses Ember.TargetActionSupport\n  @uses Ember.ClassNamesSupport\n  @uses Ember.ActionSupport\n  @uses Ember.ViewMixin\n  @uses Ember.ViewStateSupport\n  @public\n*/\n// This type param is used in the class, so must appear here.\n// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars\ninterface Component<S = unknown>\n  extends CoreView,\n    ChildViewsSupport,\n    ViewStateSupport,\n    ClassNamesSupport,\n    TargetActionSupport,\n    ActionSupport,\n    ViewMixin,\n    ComponentMethods {}\n\nclass Component<S = unknown>\n  extends CoreView.extend(\n    ChildViewsSupport,\n    ViewStateSupport,\n    ClassNamesSupport,\n    TargetActionSupport,\n    ActionSupport,\n    ViewMixin,\n    {\n      // These need to be overridable via extend/create but should still\n      // have a default.

The component takes a\n    bunch of attributes that it got passed in, and uses them to render its\n    template.\n\n    One nice thing about this model is that if you try to set a value to the\n    same thing as last time, Ember (through HTMLBars) will avoid doing any\n    work on the DOM.\n\n    This is not just a performance optimization. If an attribute has not\n    changed, it is important not to clobber the element's \"hidden state\".\n    For example, if you set an input's `value` to the same value as before,\n    it will clobber selection state and cursor position. In other words,\n    setting an attribute is not **always** idempotent.\n\n    This method provides a way to read an element's attribute and also\n    update the last value Ember knows about at the same time. This makes\n    setting an attribute idempotent.\n\n    In particular, what this means is that if you get an `<input>` element's\n    `value` attribute and then re-render the template with the same value,\n    it will avoid clobbering the cursor and selection position.\n    Since most attribute sets are idempotent in the browser, you typically\n    can get away with reading attributes using jQuery, but the most reliable\n    way to do so is through this method.\n    @method readDOMAttr\n\n    @param {String} name the name of the attribute\n    @return String\n    @public\n    */\n  readDOMAttr(name: string) {\n    // TODO revisit this\n    let _element = getViewElement(this);\n\n    assert(\n      `Cannot call \\`readDOMAttr\\` on ${this} which does not have an element`,\n      _element !== null\n    );\n\n    let element = _element;\n    let isSVG = element.namespaceURI === 'http://www.w3.org/2000/svg';\n    let { type, normalized } = normalizeProperty(element as unknown as SimpleElement, name);\n\n    if (isSVG || type === 'attr') {\n      return element.getAttribute(normalized);\n    }\n\n    return (element as any)[normalized];\n  }\n\n  // --- Declarations which support mixins ---\n  // We use `declare` on these properties, even though they are optional, so\n  // that they do not get created on the class *at all* when emitting the\n  // transpiled code.

It is an extension\n  of the base Handlebars `{{#each}}` helper.\n\n  The default behavior of `{{#each}}` is to yield its inner block once for every\n  item in an array passing the item as the first block parameter.\n\n  Assuming the `@developers` argument contains this array:\n\n  ```javascript\n  [{ name: 'Yehuda' },{ name: 'Tom' }, { name: 'Paul' }];\n  ```\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <ul>\n    {{#each @developers as |person|}}\n      <li>Hello, {{person.name}}!</li>\n    {{/each}}\n  </ul>\n  ```\n\n  The same rules apply to arrays of primitives.\n\n  ```javascript\n  ['Yehuda', 'Tom', 'Paul']\n  ```\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <ul>\n    {{#each @developerNames as |name|}}\n      <li>Hello, {{name}}!</li>\n    {{/each}}\n  </ul>\n  ```\n\n  During iteration, the index of each item in the array is provided as a second block\n  parameter.\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <ul>\n    {{#each @developers as |person index|}}\n      <li>Hello, {{person.name}}! You're number {{index}} in line</li>\n    {{/each}}\n  </ul>\n  ```\n\n  ### Specifying Keys\n\n  In order to improve rendering speed, Ember will try to reuse the DOM elements\n  where possible. Specifically, if the same item is present in the array both\n  before and after the change, its DOM output will be reused.\n\n  The `key` option is used to tell Ember how to determine if the items in the\n  array being iterated over with `{{#each}}` has changed between renders. By\n  default the item's object identity is used.\n\n  This is usually sufficient, so in most cases, the `key` option is simply not\n  needed. However, in some rare cases, the objects' identities may change even\n  though they represent the same underlying data.\n\n  For example:\n\n  ```javascript\n  people.map(person => {\n    return { ...person, type: 'developer' };\n  });\n  ```\n\n  In this case, each time the `people` array is `map`-ed over, it will produce\n  an new array with completely different objects between renders. In these cases,\n  you can help Ember determine how these objects related to each other with the\n  `key` option:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <ul>\n    {{#each @developers key=\"name\" as |person|}}\n      <li>Hello, {{person.name}}!</li>\n    {{/each}}\n  </ul>\n  ```\n\n  By doing so, Ember will use the value of the property specified (`person.name`\n  in the example) to find a \"match\" from the previous render. That is, if Ember\n  has previously seen an object from the `@developers` array with a matching\n  name, its DOM elements will be re-used.\n\n  There are two special values for `key`:\n\n    * `@index` - The index of the item in the array.\n    * `@identity` - The item in the array itself.\n\n  ### {{else}} condition\n\n  `{{#each}}` can have a matching `{{else}}`. The contents of this block will render\n  if the collection is empty.\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <ul>\n    {{#each @developers as |person|}}\n      <li>{{person.name}} is available!</li>\n    {{else}}\n      <li>Sorry, nobody is available for this task.</li>\n    {{/each}}\n  </ul>\n  ```\n\n  @method each\n  @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n  @public\n */\n\n/**\n  The `{{each-in}}` helper loops over properties on an object.\n\n  For example, given this component definition:\n\n  ```app/components/developer-details.js\n  import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n  import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';\n\n  export default class extends Component {\n    @tracked developer = {\n      \"name\": \"Shelly Sails\",\n      \"age\": 42\n    };\n  }\n  ```\n\n  This template would display all properties on the `developer`\n  object in a list:\n\n  ```app/components/developer-details.hbs\n  <ul>\n    {{#each-in this.developer as |key value|}}\n      <li>{{key}}: {{value}}</li>\n    {{/each-in}}\n  </ul>\n  ```\n\n  Outputting their name and age:\n\n  ```html\n  <ul>\n    <li>name: Shelly Sails</li>\n    <li>age: 42</li>\n  </ul>\n  ```\n\n  @method each-in\n  @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n  @public\n  @since 2.1.0\n*/\nexport class EachInWrapper {\n  constructor(public inner: unknown) {}\n}\n\nexport default internalHelper(({ positional }: CapturedArguments) => {\n  const inner = positional[0];\n  assert('expected at least one positional arg', inner);\n\n  return createComputeRef(() => {\n    let iterable = valueForRef(inner);\n\n    consumeTag(tagForObject(iterable));\n\n    if (isProxy(iterable)) {\n      // this is because the each-in doesn't actually get(proxy, 'key') but bypasses it\n      // and the proxy's tag is lazy updated on access\n      iterable = _contentFor(iterable);\n    }\n\n    return new EachInWrapper(iterable);\n  });\n});\n","import { objectAt } from '@ember/-internals/metal';\nimport type EmberArray from '@ember/array';\nimport { isEmberArray } from '@ember/array/-internals';\nimport { isObject } from '@ember/-internals/utils';\nimport type { Nullable } from '@ember/-internals/utility-types';\nimport type { IteratorDelegate } from '@glimmer/reference';\nimport { consumeTag, isTracking, tagFor } from '@glimmer/validator';\nimport { EachInWrapper } from '../helpers/each-in';\nimport type { NativeArray } from '@ember/array';\n\nexport default function toIterator(iterable: unknown): Nullable<IteratorDelegate> {\n  if (iterable instanceof EachInWrapper) {\n    return toEachInIterator(iterable.inner);\n  } else {\n    return toEachIterator(iterable);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction toEachInIterator(iterable: unknown) {\n  if (!isIndexable(iterable)) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  if (Array.isArray(iterable) || isEmberArray(iterable)) {\n    return ObjectIterator.fromIndexable(iterable);\n  } else if (isNativeIterable(iterable)) {\n    return MapLikeNativeIterator.from(iterable as Iterable<[unknown, unknown]>);\n  } else if (hasForEach(iterable)) {\n    return ObjectIterator.fromForEachable(iterable);\n  } else {\n    return ObjectIterator.fromIndexable(iterable);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction toEachIterator(iterable: unknown) {\n  if (!isObject(iterable)) {\n    return null;\n  }\n\n  if (Array.isArray(iterable)) {\n    return ArrayIterator.from(iterable);\n  } else if (isEmberArray(iterable)) {\n    return EmberArrayIterator.from(iterable);\n  } else if (isNativeIterable(iterable)) {\n    return ArrayLikeNativeIterator.from(iterable);\n  } else if (hasForEach(iterable)) {\n    return ArrayIterator.fromForEachable(iterable);\n  } else {\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n\nabstract class BoundedIterator implements IteratorDelegate {\n  private position = 0;\n\n  constructor(private length: number) {}\n\n  isEmpty(): false {\n    return false;\n  }\n\n  abstract valueFor(position: number): unknown;\n\n  memoFor(position: number): unknown {\n    return position;\n  }\n\n  next() {\n    let { length, position } = this;\n\n    if (position >= length) {\n      return null;\n    }\n\n    let value = this.valueFor(position);\n    let memo = this.memoFor(position);\n\n    this.position++;\n\n    return { value, memo };\n  }\n}\n\nclass ArrayIterator extends BoundedIterator {\n  static from(iterable: unknown[]) {\n    return iterable.length > 0 ?

It is not a\n  concrete implementation, but it can be used up by other classes that want\n  to appear like arrays.\n\n  For example, ArrayProxy is a concrete class that can be instantiated to\n  implement array-like behavior. This class uses the Array Mixin by way of\n  the MutableArray mixin, which allows observable changes to be made to the\n  underlying array.\n\n  This mixin defines methods specifically for collections that provide\n  index-ordered access to their contents. When you are designing code that\n  needs to accept any kind of Array-like object, you should use these methods\n  instead of Array primitives because these will properly notify observers of\n  changes to the array.\n\n  Although these methods are efficient, they do add a layer of indirection to\n  your application so it is a good idea to use them only when you need the\n  flexibility of using both true JavaScript arrays and \"virtual\" arrays such\n  as controllers and collections.\n\n  You can use the methods defined in this module to access and modify array\n  contents in an observable-friendly way. You can also be notified whenever\n  the membership of an array changes by using `.observes('myArray.[]')`.\n\n  To support `EmberArray` in your own class, you must override two\n  primitives to use it: `length()` and `objectAt()`.\n\n  @class EmberArray\n  @uses Enumerable\n  @since Ember 0.9.0\n  @public\n*/\ninterface EmberArray<T> extends Enumerable {\n  /**\n    __Required.__ You must implement this method to apply this mixin.\n\n    Your array must support the `length` property.

It's part of the\n    spec. Sorry.\n\n    Example Usage:\n\n    ```javascript\n      let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];\n\n      numbers.reduce(function(summation, current) {\n        return summation + current;\n      }); // 15 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)\n\n      numbers.reduce(function(summation, current) {\n        return summation + current;\n      }, -15); // 0 (-15 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5)\n\n\n      let binaryValues = [true, false, false];\n\n      binaryValues.reduce(function(truthValue, current) {\n        return truthValue && current;\n      }); // false (true && false && false)\n    ```\n\n    @method reduce\n    @param {Function} callback The callback to execute\n    @param {Object} initialValue Initial value for the reduce\n    @return {Object} The reduced value.\n    @public\n  */\n  reduce<V>(\n    callback: (summation: V, current: T, index: number, arr: this) => V,\n    initialValue?: V\n  ): V;\n  /**\n    Invokes the named method on every object in the receiver that\n    implements it.

The sort\n  macro can be used in two different ways:\n\n  1. By providing a sort callback function\n  2. By providing an array of keys to sort the array\n\n  In the first form, the callback method you provide should have the following\n  signature:\n\n  ```javascript\n  function sortCallback(itemA, itemB);\n  ```\n\n  - `itemA` the first item to compare.\n  - `itemB` the second item to compare.\n\n  This function should return negative number (e.g. `-1`) when `itemA` should\n  come before `itemB`. It should return positive number (e.g. `1`) when `itemA`\n  should come after `itemB`. If the `itemA` and `itemB` are equal this function\n  should return `0`.\n\n  Therefore, if this function is comparing some numeric values, simple `itemA -\n  itemB` or `itemA.get( 'foo' ) - itemB.get( 'foo' )` can be used instead of\n  series of `if`.\n\n  Example:\n\n  ```javascript\n  import { set } from '@ember/object';\n  import { sort } from '@ember/object/computed';\n\n  class ToDoList {\n    constructor(todos) {\n      set(this, 'todos', todos);\n    }\n\n    // using a custom sort function\n    @sort('todos', function(a, b){\n      if (a.priority > b.priority) {\n        return 1;\n      } else if (a.priority < b.priority) {\n        return -1;\n      }\n\n      return 0;\n    })\n    priorityTodos;\n  }\n\n  let todoList = new ToDoList([\n    { name: 'Unit Test', priority: 2 },\n    { name: 'Documentation', priority: 3 },\n    { name: 'Release', priority: 1 }\n  ]);\n\n  todoList.priorityTodos; // [{ name:'Release', priority:1 }, { name:'Unit Test', priority:2 }, { name:'Documentation', priority:3 }]\n  ```\n\n  You can also optionally pass an array of additional dependent keys as the\n  second parameter, if your sort function is dependent on additional values that\n  could changes:\n\n  ```js\n  import EmberObject, { set } from '@ember/object';\n  import { sort } from '@ember/object/computed';\n\n  class ToDoList {\n    sortKey = 'priority';\n\n    constructor(todos) {\n      set(this, 'todos', todos);\n    }\n\n    // using a custom sort function\n    @sort('todos', ['sortKey'], function(a, b){\n      if (a[this.sortKey] > b[this.sortKey]) {\n        return 1;\n      } else if (a[this.sortKey] < b[this.sortKey]) {\n        return -1;\n      }\n\n      return 0;\n    })\n    sortedTodos;\n  });\n\n  let todoList = new ToDoList([\n    { name: 'Unit Test', priority: 2 },\n    { name: 'Documentation', priority: 3 },\n    { name: 'Release', priority: 1 }\n  ]);\n\n  todoList.priorityTodos; // [{ name:'Release', priority:1 }, { name:'Unit Test', priority:2 }, { name:'Documentation', priority:3 }]\n  ```\n\n  In the second form, you should provide the key of the array of sort values as\n  the second parameter:\n\n  ```javascript\n  import { set } from '@ember/object';\n  import { sort } from '@ember/object/computed';\n\n  class ToDoList {\n    constructor(todos) {\n      set(this, 'todos', todos);\n    }\n\n    // using standard ascending sort\n    todosSorting = ['name'];\n    @sort('todos', 'todosSorting') sortedTodos;\n\n    // using descending sort\n    todosSortingDesc = ['name:desc'];\n    @sort('todos', 'todosSortingDesc') sortedTodosDesc;\n  }\n\n  let todoList = new ToDoList([\n    { name: 'Unit Test', priority: 2 },\n    { name: 'Documentation', priority: 3 },\n    { name: 'Release', priority: 1 }\n  ]);\n\n  todoList.sortedTodos; // [{ name:'Documentation', priority:3 }, { name:'Release', priority:1 }, { name:'Unit Test', priority:2 }]\n  todoList.sortedTodosDesc; // [{ name:'Unit Test', priority:2 }, { name:'Release', priority:1 }, { name:'Documentation', priority:3 }]\n  ```\n\n  @method sort\n  @for @ember/object/computed\n  @static\n  @param {String} itemsKey\n  @param {String|Function|Array} sortDefinitionOrDependentKeys The key of the sort definition (an array of sort properties),\n  the sort function, or an array of additional dependent keys\n  @param {Function?} sortDefinition the sort function (when used with additional dependent keys)\n  @return {ComputedProperty} computes a new sorted array based on the sort\n  property array or callback function\n  @public\n*/\nexport function sort(itemsKey: string, sortDefinition: SortDefinition | string): PropertyDecorator;\nexport function sort(\n  itemsKey: string,\n  additionalDependentKeys: string[],\n  sortDefinition: SortDefinition\n): PropertyDecorator;\nexport function sort(\n  itemsKey: string,\n  additionalDependentKeysOrDefinition: SortDefinition | string | string[],\n  sortDefinition?: SortDefinition\n): PropertyDecorator {\n  assert(\n    'You attempted to use @sort as a decorator directly, but it requires atleast an `itemsKey` parameter',\n    !isElementDescriptor(Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments))\n  );\n\n  if (DEBUG) {\n    let argumentsValid = false;\n\n    if (arguments.length === 2) {\n      argumentsValid =\n        typeof itemsKey === 'string' &&\n        (typeof additionalDependentKeysOrDefinition === 'string' ||\n          typeof additionalDependentKeysOrDefinition === 'function');\n    }\n\n    if (arguments.length === 3) {\n      argumentsValid =\n        typeof itemsKey === 'string' &&\n        Array.isArray(additionalDependentKeysOrDefinition) &&\n        typeof sortDefinition === 'function';\n    }\n\n    assert(\n      'The `sort` computed macro can either be used with an array of sort properties or with a sort function.

The primary concrete implementations of `Owner` are `EngineInstance`,\n  from `@ember/engine/instance`, and its `ApplicationInstance` subclass, from\n  `@ember/application/instance`.\n\n  Along with `Owner` itself, this module provides a number of supporting types\n  related to Ember's DI system:\n\n  - `Factory`, Ember's primary interface for something which can create class\n    instances registered with the DI system.\n\n  - `FactoryManager`, an interface for inspecting a `Factory`'s class.\n\n  - `Resolver`, an interface defining the contract for the object responsible\n    for mapping string names to the corresponding classes. For example, when you\n    write `@service('session')`, a resolver is responsible to map that back to\n    the `Session` service class in your codebase. Normally, this is handled for\n    you automatically with `ember-resolver`, which is the main implementor of\n    this interface.\n\n  For more details on each, see their per-item docs.\n\n  @module @ember/owner\n  @public\n*/\n\n// We need to provide a narrower public interface to `getOwner` so that we only\n// expose the `Owner` type, *not* our richer `InternalOwner` type and its\n// various bits of private API.\nimport { type default as Owner, getOwner as internalGetOwner } from '@ember/-internals/owner';\n\n// NOTE: this documentation appears here instead of at the definition site so\n// it can appear correctly in both API docs and for TS, while providing a richer\n// internal representation for Ember's own usage.\n/**\n  Framework objects in an Ember application (components, services, routes, etc.)\n  are created via a factory and dependency injection system. Each of these\n  objects is the responsibility of an \"owner\", which handled its\n  instantiation and manages its lifetime.\n\n  `getOwner` fetches the owner object responsible for an instance. This can\n  be used to lookup or resolve other class instances, or register new factories\n  into the owner.\n\n  For example, this component dynamically looks up a service based on the\n  `audioType` passed as an argument:\n\n  ```app/components/play-audio.js\n  import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n  import { action } from '@ember/object';\n  import { getOwner } from '@ember/owner';\n\n  // Usage:\n  //\n  //   <PlayAudio @audioType={{@model.audioType}} @audioFile={{@model.file}}/>\n  //\n  export default class extends Component {\n    get audioService() {\n      return getOwner(this)?.lookup(`service:${this.args.audioType}`);\n    }\n\n    @action\n    onPlay() {\n      this.audioService?.play(this.args.audioFile);\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  @method getOwner\n  @static\n  @for @ember/owner\n  @param {Object} object An object with an owner.\n  @return {Object} An owner object.\n  @since 2.3.0\n  @public\n*/\n// SAFETY: the cast here is necessary, instead of using an assignment, because\n// TS (not incorrectly!

### Showing a property\n\n  Templates manage the flow of an application's UI, and display state (through\n  the DOM) to a user. For example, given a component with the property \"name\",\n  that component's template can use the name in several ways:\n\n  ```app/components/person-profile.js\n  import Component from '@ember/component';\n\n  export default Component.extend({\n    name: 'Jill'\n  });\n  ```\n\n  ```app/components/person-profile.hbs\n  {{this.name}}\n  <div>{{this.name}}</div>\n  <span data-name={{this.name}}></span>\n  ```\n\n  Any time the \"name\" property on the component changes, the DOM will be\n  updated.\n\n  Properties can be chained as well:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{@aUserModel.name}}\n  <div>{{@listOfUsers.firstObject.name}}</div>\n  ```\n\n  ### Using Ember helpers\n\n  When content is passed in mustaches `{{}}`, Ember will first try to find a helper\n  or component with that name. For example, the `if` helper:\n\n  ```app/components/person-profile.hbs\n  {{if this.name \"I have a name\" \"I have no name\"}}\n  <span data-has-name={{if this.name true}}></span>\n  ```\n\n  The returned value is placed where the `{{}}` is called. The above style is\n  called \"inline\". A second style of helper usage is called \"block\". For example:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  {{#if this.name}}\n    I have a name\n  {{else}}\n    I have no name\n  {{/if}}\n  ```\n\n  The block form of helpers allows you to control how the UI is created based\n  on the values of properties.\n  A third form of helper is called \"nested\". For example here the concat\n  helper will add \" Doe\" to a displayed name if the person has no last name:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <span data-name={{concat this.firstName (\n    if this.lastName (concat \" \" this.lastName) \"Doe\"\n  )}}></span>\n  ```\n\n  Ember's built-in helpers are described under the [Ember.Templates.helpers](/ember/release/classes/Ember.Templates.helpers)\n  namespace. Documentation on creating custom helpers can be found under\n  [helper](/ember/release/functions/@ember%2Fcomponent%2Fhelper/helper) (or\n  under [Helper](/ember/release/classes/Helper) if a helper requires access to\n  dependency injection).\n\n  ### Invoking a Component\n\n  Ember components represent state to the UI of an application. Further\n  reading on components can be found under [Component](/ember/release/classes/Component).\n\n  @module @ember/component\n  @main @ember/component\n  @public\n */\n\n/**\n @module ember\n */\n\n/**\n @class Ember.Templates.helpers\n @public\n */\n\n/**\n  `{{yield}}` denotes an area of a template that will be rendered inside\n  of another template.\n\n  ### Use with `Component`\n\n  When designing components `{{yield}}` is used to denote where, inside the component's\n  template, an optional block passed to the component should render:\n\n  ```app/templates/application.hbs\n  <LabeledTextfield @value={{@model.name}}>\n    First name:\n  </LabeledTextfield>\n  ```\n\n  ```app/components/labeled-textfield.hbs\n  <label>\n    {{yield}} <Input @value={{@value}} />\n  </label>\n  ```\n\n  Result:\n\n  ```html\n  <label>\n    First name: <input type=\"text\" />\n  </label>\n  ```\n\n  Additionally you can `yield` properties into the context for use by the consumer:\n\n  ```app/templates/application.hbs\n  <LabeledTextfield @value={{@model.validation}} @validator={{this.firstNameValidator}} as |validationError|>\n    {{#if validationError}}\n      <p class=\"error\">{{validationError}}</p>\n    {{/if}}\n    First name:\n  </LabeledTextfield>\n  ```\n\n  ```app/components/labeled-textfield.hbs\n  <label>\n    {{yield this.validationError}} <Input @value={{@value}} />\n  </label>\n  ```\n\n  Result:\n\n  ```html\n  <label>\n    <p class=\"error\">First Name must be at least 3 characters long.</p>\n    First name: <input type=\"text\" />\n  </label>\n  ```\n\n  `yield` can also be used with the `hash` helper:\n\n  ```app/templates/application.hbs\n  <DateRanges @value={{@model.date}} as |range|>\n    Start date: {{range.start}}\n    End date: {{range.end}}\n  </DateRanges>\n  ```\n\n  ```app/components/date-ranges.hbs\n  <div>\n    {{yield (hash start=@value.start end=@value.end)}}\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  Result:\n\n  ```html\n  <div>\n    Start date: July 1st\n    End date: July 30th\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  Multiple values can be yielded as block params:\n\n  ```app/templates/application.hbs\n  <Banner @value={{@model}} as |title subtitle body|>\n    <h1>{{title}}</h1>\n    <h2>{{subtitle}}</h2>\n    {{body}}\n  </Banner>\n  ```\n\n  ```app/components/banner.hbs\n  <div>\n    {{yield \"Hello title\" \"hello subtitle\" \"body text\"}}\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  Result:\n\n  ```html\n  <div>\n    <h1>Hello title</h1>\n    <h2>hello subtitle</h2>\n    body text\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  However, it is preferred to use the hash helper, as this can prevent breaking changes to your component and also simplify the api for the component.\n\n  Multiple components can be yielded with the `hash` and `component` helper:\n\n  ```app/templates/application.hbs\n  <Banner @value={{@model}} as |banner|>\n    <banner.Title>Banner title</banner.Title>\n    <banner.Subtitle>Banner subtitle</banner.Subtitle>\n    <banner.Body>A load of body text</banner.Body>\n  </Banner>\n  ```\n\n  ```app/components/banner.js\n  import Title from './banner/title';\n  import Subtitle from './banner/subtitle';\n  import Body from './banner/body';\n\n  export default class Banner extends Component {\n    Title = Title;\n    Subtitle = Subtitle;\n    Body = Body;\n  }\n  ```\n\n  ```app/components/banner.hbs\n  <div>\n    {{yield (hash\n      Title=this.Title\n      Subtitle=this.Subtitle\n      Body=(component this.Body defaultArg=\"some value\")\n    )}}\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  Result:\n\n  ```html\n  <div>\n    <h1>Banner title</h1>\n    <h2>Banner subtitle</h2>\n    A load of body text\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  A benefit of using this pattern is that the user of the component can change the order the components are displayed.\n\n  ```app/templates/application.hbs\n  <Banner @value={{@model}} as |banner|>\n    <banner.Subtitle>Banner subtitle</banner.Subtitle>\n    <banner.Title>Banner title</banner.Title>\n    <banner.Body>A load of body text</banner.Body>\n  </Banner>\n  ```\n\n  Result:\n\n  ```html\n  <div>\n    <h2>Banner subtitle</h2>\n    <h1>Banner title</h1>\n    A load of body text\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  Another benefit to using `yield` with the `hash` and `component` helper\n  is you can pass attributes and arguments to these components:\n\n  ```app/templates/application.hbs\n  <Banner @value={{@model}} as |banner|>\n    <banner.Subtitle class=\"mb-1\">Banner subtitle</banner.Subtitle>\n    <banner.Title @variant=\"loud\">Banner title</banner.Title>\n    <banner.Body>A load of body text</banner.Body>\n  </Banner>\n  ```\n\n  ```app/components/banner/subtitle.hbs\n  {{!-- note the use of ..attributes --}}\n  <h2 ...attributes>\n    {{yield}}\n  </h2>\n  ```\n\n  ```app/components/banner/title.hbs\n  {{#if (eq @variant \"loud\")}}\n      <h1 class=\"loud\">{{yield}}</h1>\n  {{else}}\n      <h1 class=\"quiet\">{{yield}}</h1>\n  {{/if}}\n  ```\n\n  Result:\n\n  ```html\n  <div>\n    <h2 class=\"mb-1\">Banner subtitle</h2>\n    <h1 class=\"loud\">Banner title</h1>\n    A load of body text\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  @method yield\n  @for Ember.Templates.helpers\n  @param {Hash} options\n  @return {String} HTML string\n  @public\n */\n\n/**\n  `{{(has-block)}}` indicates if the component was invoked with a block.\n\n  This component is invoked with a block:\n\n

It instantiates, initializes and coordinates the\n  objects that make up your app.\n\n  Each Ember app has one and only one `Application` object. Although\n  Ember CLI creates this object implicitly, the `Application` class\n  is defined in the `app/app.js`. You can define a `ready` method on the\n  `Application` class, which will be run by Ember when the application is\n  initialized.\n\n  ```app/app.js\n  export default class App extends Application {\n    ready() {\n      // your code here\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Because `Application` ultimately inherits from `Ember.Namespace`, any classes\n  you create will have useful string representations when calling `toString()`.\n  See the `Ember.Namespace` documentation for more information.\n\n  While you can think of your `Application` as a container that holds the\n  other classes in your application, there are several other responsibilities\n  going on under-the-hood that you may want to understand. It is also important\n  to understand that an `Application` is different from an `ApplicationInstance`.\n  Refer to the Guides to understand the difference between these.\n\n  ### Event Delegation\n\n  Ember uses a technique called _event delegation_. This allows the framework\n  to set up a global, shared event listener instead of requiring each view to\n  do it manually. For example, instead of each view registering its own\n  `mousedown` listener on its associated element, Ember sets up a `mousedown`\n  listener on the `body`.\n\n  If a `mousedown` event occurs, Ember will look at the target of the event and\n  start walking up the DOM node tree, finding corresponding views and invoking\n  their `mouseDown` method as it goes.\n\n  `Application` has a number of default events that it listens for, as\n  well as a mapping from lowercase events to camel-cased view method names. For\n  example, the `keypress` event causes the `keyPress` method on the view to be\n  called, the `dblclick` event causes `doubleClick` to be called, and so on.\n\n  If there is a bubbling browser event that Ember does not listen for by\n  default, you can specify custom events and their corresponding view method\n  names by setting the application's `customEvents` property:\n\n  ```app/app.js\n  import Application from '@ember/application';\n\n  export default class App extends Application {\n    customEvents = {\n      // add support for the paste event\n      paste: 'paste'\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  To prevent Ember from setting up a listener for a default event,\n  specify the event name with a `null` value in the `customEvents`\n  property:\n\n  ```app/app.js\n  import Application from '@ember/application';\n\n  export default class App extends Application {\n    customEvents = {\n      // prevent listeners for mouseenter/mouseleave events\n      mouseenter: null,\n      mouseleave: null\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  By default, the application sets up these event listeners on the document\n  body. However, in cases where you are embedding an Ember application inside\n  an existing page, you may want it to set up the listeners on an element\n  inside the body.\n\n  For example, if only events inside a DOM element with the ID of `ember-app`\n  should be delegated, set your application's `rootElement` property:\n\n  ```app/app.js\n  import Application from '@ember/application';\n\n  export default class App extends Application {\n    rootElement = '#ember-app'\n  }\n  ```\n\n  The `rootElement` can be either a DOM element or a CSS selector\n  string. Note that *views appended to the DOM outside the root element will\n  not receive events.* If you specify a custom root element, make sure you only\n  append views inside it!\n\n  To learn more about the events Ember components use, see\n\n  [components/handling-events](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/components/handling-events/#toc_event-names).\n\n  ### Initializers\n\n  To add behavior to the Application's boot process, you can define initializers in\n  the `app/initializers` directory, or with `ember generate initializer` using Ember CLI.\n  These files should export a named `initialize` function which will receive the created `application`\n  object as its first argument.\n\n  ```javascript\n  export function initialize(application) {\n    // application.inject('route', 'foo', 'service:foo');\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Application initializers can be used for a variety of reasons including:\n\n  - setting up external libraries\n  - injecting dependencies\n  - setting up event listeners in embedded apps\n  - deferring the boot process using the `deferReadiness` and `advanceReadiness` APIs.\n\n  ### Routing\n\n  In addition to creating your application's router, `Application` is\n  also responsible for telling the router when to start routing. Transitions\n  between routes can be logged with the `LOG_TRANSITIONS` flag, and more\n  detailed intra-transition logging can be logged with\n  the `LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL` flag:\n\n  ```javascript\n  import Application from '@ember/application';\n\n  let App = Application.create({\n    LOG_TRANSITIONS: true, // basic logging of successful transitions\n    LOG_TRANSITIONS_INTERNAL: true // detailed logging of all routing steps\n  });\n  ```\n\n  By default, the router will begin trying to translate the current URL into\n  application state once the browser emits the `DOMContentReady` event. If you\n  need to defer routing, you can call the application's `deferReadiness()`\n  method. Once routing can begin, call the `advanceReadiness()` method.\n\n  If there is any setup required before routing begins, you can implement a\n  `ready()` method on your app that will be invoked immediately before routing\n  begins.\n\n  @class Application\n  @extends Engine\n  @public\n*/\n\nclass Application extends Engine {\n  /**\n    This creates a registry with the default Ember naming conventions.\n\n    It also configures the registry:\n\n    * registered views are created every time they are looked up (they are\n      not singletons)\n    * registered templates are not factories; the registered value is\n      returned directly.\n    * the router receives the application as its `namespace` property\n    * all controllers receive the router as their `target` and `controllers`\n      properties\n    * all controllers receive the application as their `namespace` property\n    * the application view receives the application controller as its\n      `controller` property\n    * the application view receives the application template as its\n      `defaultTemplate` property\n\n    @method buildRegistry\n    @static\n    @param {Application} namespace the application for which to\n      build the registry\n    @return {Ember.Registry} the built registry\n    @private\n  */\n  static buildRegistry(namespace: Application) {\n    let registry = super.buildRegistry(namespace);\n\n    commonSetupRegistry(registry);\n\n    setupApplicationRegistry(registry);\n\n    return registry;\n  }\n\n  static initializer = buildInitializerMethod<'initializers', Application>(\n    'initializers',\n    'initializer'\n  );\n\n  static instanceInitializer = buildInitializerMethod<'instanceInitializers', ApplicationInstance>(\n    'instanceInitializers',\n    'instance initializer'\n  );\n\n  /**\n    The root DOM element of the Application.

See the documentation on\n    `ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` for details.\n\n    `ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` is an interface class that exists\n    purely to document the available options; you do not need to construct it\n    manually. Simply pass a regular JavaScript object containing of the\n    desired options:\n\n    ```javascript\n    MyApp.visit(\"/\", { location: \"none\", rootElement: \"#container\" });\n    ```\n\n    ### Supported Scenarios\n\n    While the `BootOptions` class exposes a large number of knobs, not all\n    combinations of them are valid; certain incompatible combinations might\n    result in unexpected behavior.\n\n    For example, booting the instance in the full browser environment\n    while specifying a foreign `document` object (e.g. `{ isBrowser: true,\n    document: iframe.contentDocument }`) does not work correctly today,\n    largely due to Ember's jQuery dependency.\n\n    Currently, there are three officially supported scenarios/configurations.\n    Usages outside of these scenarios are not guaranteed to work, but please\n    feel free to file bug reports documenting your experience and any issues\n    you encountered to help expand support.\n\n    #### Browser Applications (Manual Boot)\n\n    The setup is largely similar to how Ember works out-of-the-box. Normally,\n    Ember will boot a default instance for your Application on \"DOM ready\".\n    However, you can customize this behavior by disabling `autoboot`.\n\n    For example, this allows you to render a miniture demo of your application\n    into a specific area on your marketing website:\n\n    ```javascript\n    import MyApp from 'my-app';\n\n    $(function() {\n      let App = MyApp.create({ autoboot: false });\n\n      let options = {\n        // Override the router's location adapter to prevent it from updating\n        // the URL in the address bar\n        location: 'none',\n\n        // Override the default `rootElement` on the app to render into a\n        // specific `div` on the page\n        rootElement: '#demo'\n      };\n\n      // Start the app at the special demo URL\n      App.visit('/demo', options);\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Or perhaps you might want to boot two instances of your app on the same\n    page for a split-screen multiplayer experience:\n\n    ```javascript\n    import MyApp from 'my-app';\n\n    $(function() {\n      let App = MyApp.create({ autoboot: false });\n\n      let sessionId = MyApp.generateSessionID();\n\n      let player1 = App.visit(`/matches/join?name=Player+1&session=${sessionId}`, { rootElement: '#left', location: 'none' });\n      let player2 = App.visit(`/matches/join?name=Player+2&session=${sessionId}`, { rootElement: '#right', location: 'none' });\n\n      Promise.all([player1, player2]).then(() => {\n        // Both apps have completed the initial render\n        $('#loading').fadeOut();\n      });\n    });\n    ```\n\n    Do note that each app instance maintains their own registry/container, so\n    they will run in complete isolation by default.\n\n    #### Server-Side Rendering (also known as FastBoot)\n\n    This setup allows you to run your Ember app in a server environment using\n    Node.js and render its content into static HTML for SEO purposes.\n\n    ```javascript\n    const HTMLSerializer = new SimpleDOM.HTMLSerializer(SimpleDOM.voidMap);\n\n    function renderURL(url) {\n      let dom = new SimpleDOM.Document();\n      let rootElement = dom.body;\n      let options = { isBrowser: false, document: dom, rootElement: rootElement };\n\n      return MyApp.visit(options).then(instance => {\n        try {\n          return HTMLSerializer.serialize(rootElement.firstChild);\n        } finally {\n          instance.destroy();\n        }\n      });\n    }\n    ```\n\n    In this scenario, because Ember does not have access to a global `document`\n    object in the Node.js environment, you must provide one explicitly. In practice,\n    in the non-browser environment, the stand-in `document` object only needs to\n    implement a limited subset of the full DOM API. The `SimpleDOM` library is known\n    to work.\n\n    Since there is no DOM access in the non-browser environment, you must also\n    specify a DOM `Element` object in the same `document` for the `rootElement` option\n    (as opposed to a selector string like `\"body\"`).\n\n    See the documentation on the `isBrowser`, `document` and `rootElement` properties\n    on `ApplicationInstance.BootOptions` for details.\n\n    #### Server-Side Resource Discovery\n\n    This setup allows you to run the routing layer of your Ember app in a server\n    environment using Node.js and completely disable rendering. This allows you\n    to simulate and discover the resources (i.e. AJAX requests) needed to fulfill\n    a given request and eagerly \"push\" these resources to the client.\n\n    ```app/initializers/network-service.js\n    import BrowserNetworkService from 'app/services/network/browser';\n    import NodeNetworkService from 'app/services/network/node';\n\n    // Inject a (hypothetical) service for abstracting all AJAX calls and use\n    // the appropriate implementation on the client/server. This also allows the\n    // server to log all the AJAX calls made during a particular request and use\n    // that for resource-discovery purpose.\n\n    export function initialize(application) {\n      if (window) { // browser\n        application.register('service:network', BrowserNetworkService);\n      } else { // node\n        application.register('service:network', NodeNetworkService);\n      }\n    };\n\n    export default {\n      name: 'network-service',\n      initialize: initialize\n    };\n    ```\n\n    ```app/routes/post.js\n    import Route from '@ember/routing/route';\n    import { service } from '@ember/service';\n\n    // An example of how the (hypothetical) service is used in routes.\n\n    export default class IndexRoute extends Route {\n      @service network;\n\n      model(params) {\n        return this.network.fetch(`/api/posts/${params.post_id}.json`);\n      }\n\n      afterModel(post) {\n        if (post.isExternalContent) {\n          return this.network.fetch(`/api/external/?url=${post.externalURL}`);\n        } else {\n          return post;\n        }\n      }\n    }\n    ```\n\n    ```javascript\n    // Finally, put all the pieces together\n\n    function discoverResourcesFor(url) {\n      return MyApp.visit(url, { isBrowser: false, shouldRender: false }).then(instance => {\n        let networkService = instance.lookup('service:network');\n        return networkService.requests; // => { \"/api/posts/123.json\": \"...\" }\n      });\n    }\n    ```\n\n    @public\n    @method visit\n    @param url {String} The initial URL to navigate to\n    @param options {ApplicationInstance.BootOptions}\n    @return {Promise<ApplicationInstance, Error>}\n  */\n  visit(url: string, options: BootOptions) {\n    assert(\n      'You cannot visit this application since it has already been destroyed',\n      !this.isDestroyed\n    );\n\n    assert('You cannot visit this application since it is being destroyed', !this.isDestroying);\n\n    return this.boot().then(() => {\n      let instance = this.buildInstance();\n\n      return instance\n        .boot(options)\n        .then(() => instance.visit(url))\n        .catch((error) => {\n          run(instance, 'destroy');\n          throw error;\n        });\n    });\n  }\n}\n\nfunction commonSetupRegistry(registry: Registry) {\n  registry.register('router:main', Router);\n  registry.register('-view-registry:main', {\n    create() {\n      return dictionary(null);\n    },\n  });\n\n  registry.register('route:basic', Route);\n  registry.register('event_dispatcher:main', EventDispatcher);\n\n  registry.register('location:hash', HashLocation);\n  registry.register('location:history', HistoryLocation);\n  registry.register('location:none', NoneLocation);\n\n  registry.register(P`-bucket-cache:main`, {\n    create() {\n      return new BucketCache();\n    },\n  });\n\n  registry.register('service:router', RouterService);\n}\n\nexport { Application as default, _loaded, onLoad, runLoadHooks };\n","/**\n@module @ember/array/proxy\n*/\n\nimport {\n  objectAt,\n  alias,\n  PROPERTY_DID_CHANGE,\n  addArrayObserver,\n  removeArrayObserver,\n  replace,\n  arrayContentDidChange,\n  arrayContentWillChange,\n  tagForProperty,\n} from '@ember/-internals/metal';\nimport { get } from '@ember/object';\nimport type { PropertyDidChange } from '@ember/-internals/metal';\nimport { isObject } from '@ember/-internals/utils';\nimport EmberObject from '@ember/object';\nimport EmberArray, { type NativeArray } from '@ember/array';\nimport MutableArray from '@ember/array/mutable';\nimport { assert } from '@ember/debug';\nimport { setCustomTagFor } from '@glimmer/manager';\nimport {\n  combine,\n  consumeTag,\n  validateTag,\n  valueForTag,\n  tagFor,\n  type Tag,\n  type Revision,\n} from '@glimmer/validator';\n\nfunction isMutable<T>(obj: T[] | EmberArray<T>): obj is T[] | MutableArray<T> {\n  return Array.isArray(obj) || typeof (obj as MutableArray<T>).replace === 'function';\n}\n\nconst ARRAY_OBSERVER_MAPPING = {\n  willChange: '_arrangedContentArrayWillChange',\n  didChange: '_arrangedContentArrayDidChange',\n};\n\nfunction customTagForArrayProxy(proxy: object, key: string) {\n  assert('[BUG] Expected a proxy', proxy instanceof ArrayProxy);\n\n  if (key === '[]') {\n    proxy._revalidate();\n\n    return proxy._arrTag!;\n  } else if (key === 'length') {\n    proxy._revalidate();\n\n    return proxy._lengthTag!;\n  }\n\n  return tagFor(proxy, key);\n}\n\n/**\n  An ArrayProxy wraps any other object that implements `Array` and/or\n  `MutableArray,` forwarding all requests. This makes it very useful for\n  a number of binding use cases or other cases where being able to swap\n  out the underlying array is useful.\n\n  A simple example of usage:\n\n  ```javascript\n  import { A } from '@ember/array';\n  import ArrayProxy from '@ember/array/proxy';\n\n  let pets = ['dog', 'cat', 'fish'];\n  let ap = ArrayProxy.create({ content: A(pets) });\n\n  ap.get('firstObject');                        // 'dog'\n  ap.set('content', ['amoeba', 'paramecium']);\n  ap.get('firstObject');                        // 'amoeba'\n  ```\n\n  This class can also be useful as a layer to transform the contents of\n  an array, as they are accessed. This can be done by overriding\n  `objectAtContent`:\n\n  ```javascript\n  import { A } from '@ember/array';\n  import ArrayProxy from '@ember/array/proxy';\n\n  let pets = ['dog', 'cat', 'fish'];\n  let ap = ArrayProxy.create({\n      content: A(pets),\n      objectAtContent: function(idx) {\n          return this.get('content').objectAt(idx).toUpperCase();\n      }\n  });\n\n  ap.get('firstObject'); // . 'DOG'\n  ```\n\n  When overriding this class, it is important to place the call to\n  `_super` *after* setting `content` so the internal observers have\n  a chance to fire properly:\n\n  ```javascript\n  import { A } from '@ember/array';\n  import ArrayProxy from '@ember/array/proxy';\n\n  export default ArrayProxy.extend({\n    init() {\n      this.set('content', A(['dog', 'cat', 'fish']));\n      this._super(...arguments);\n    }\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @class ArrayProxy\n  @extends EmberObject\n  @uses MutableArray\n  @public\n*/\ninterface ArrayProxy<T> extends MutableArray<T> {\n  /**\n    The content array.

This manager then receives the value and can create and manage an\n  instance of a helper from it. This provides a layer of indirection that allows\n  users to design high-level helper APIs, without Ember needing to worry about the\n  details. High-level APIs can be experimented with and iterated on while the\n  core of Ember helpers remains stable, and new APIs can be introduced gradually\n  over time to existing code bases.\n\n  `setHelperManager` receives two arguments:\n\n  1. A factory function, which receives the `owner` and returns an instance of a\n    helper manager.\n  2. A helper definition, which is the object or function to associate the factory function with.\n\n  The first time the object is looked up, the factory function will be called to\n  create the helper manager. It will be cached, and in subsequent lookups the\n  cached helper manager will be used instead.\n\n  Only one helper manager is guaranteed to exist per `owner` and per usage of\n  `setHelperManager`, so many helpers will end up using the same instance of the\n  helper manager. As such, you should only store state that is related to the\n  manager itself. If you want to store state specific to a particular helper\n  definition, you should assign a unique helper manager to that helper. In\n  general, most managers should either be stateless, or only have the `owner` they\n  were created with as state.\n\n  Helper managers must fulfill the following interface (This example uses\n  [TypeScript interfaces](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html)\n  for precision, you do not need to write helper managers using TypeScript):\n\n  ```ts\n  interface HelperManager<HelperStateBucket> {\n    capabilities: HelperCapabilities;\n\n    createHelper(definition: HelperDefinition, args: TemplateArgs): HelperStateBucket;\n\n    getValue?(bucket: HelperStateBucket): unknown;\n\n    runEffect?(bucket: HelperStateBucket): void;\n\n    getDestroyable?(bucket: HelperStateBucket): object;\n  }\n  ```\n\n  The capabilities property _must_ be provided using the `capabilities()` function\n  imported from the same module as `setHelperManager`:\n\n  ```js\n  import { capabilities } from '@ember/helper';\n\n  class MyHelperManager {\n    capabilities = capabilities('3.21.0', { hasValue: true });\n\n    // ...snip...\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Below is a description of each of the methods on the interface and their\n  functions.\n\n  #### `createHelper`\n\n  `createHelper` is a required hook on the HelperManager interface. The hook is\n  passed the definition of the helper that is currently being created, and is\n  expected to return a _state bucket_. This state bucket is what represents the\n  current state of the helper, and will be passed to the other lifecycle hooks at\n  appropriate times. It is not necessarily related to the definition of the\n  helper itself - for instance, you could return an object _containing_ an\n  instance of the helper:\n\n  ```js\n  class MyManager {\n    createHelper(Definition, args) {\n      return {\n        instance: new Definition(args);\n      };\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  This allows the manager to store metadata that it doesn't want to expose to the\n  user.\n\n  This hook is _not_ autotracked - changes to tracked values used within this hook\n  will _not_ result in a call to any of the other lifecycle hooks. This is because\n  it is unclear what should happen if it invalidates, and rather than make a\n  decision at this point, the initial API is aiming to allow as much expressivity\n  as possible. This could change in the future with changes to capabilities and\n  their behaviors.\n\n  If users do want to autotrack some values used during construction, they can\n  either create the instance of the helper in `runEffect` or `getValue`, or they\n  can use the `cache` API to autotrack the `createHelper` hook themselves. This\n  provides maximum flexibility and expressiveness to manager authors.\n\n  This hook has the following timing semantics:\n\n  **Always**\n  - called as discovered during DOM construction\n  - called in definition order in the template\n\n  #### `getValue`\n\n  `getValue` is an optional hook that should return the value of the helper. This\n  is the value that is returned from the helper and passed into the template.\n\n  This hook is called when the value is requested from the helper (e.g. when the\n  template is rendering and the helper value is needed). The hook is autotracked,\n  and will rerun whenever any tracked values used inside of it are updated.\n  Otherwise it does not rerun.\n\n  > Note: This means that arguments which are not _consumed_ within the hook will\n  > not trigger updates.\n\n  This hook is only called for helpers with the `hasValue` capability enabled.\n  This hook has the following timing semantics:\n\n  **Always**\n  - called the first time the helper value is requested\n  - called after autotracked state has changed\n\n  **Never**\n  - called if the `hasValue` capability is disabled\n\n  #### `runEffect`\n\n  `runEffect` is an optional hook that should run the effect that the helper is\n  applying, setting it up or updating it.\n\n  This hook is scheduled to be called some time after render and prior to paint.\n  There is not a guaranteed, 1-to-1 relationship between a render pass and this\n  hook firing. For instance, multiple render passes could occur, and the hook may\n  only trigger once. It may also never trigger if it was dirtied in one render\n  pass and then destroyed in the next.\n\n  The hook is autotracked, and will rerun whenever any tracked values used inside\n  of it are updated. Otherwise it does not rerun.\n\n  The hook is also run during a time period where state mutations are _disabled_\n  in Ember. Any tracked state mutation will throw an error during this time,\n  including changes to tracked properties, changes made using `Ember.set`, updates\n  to computed properties, etc. This is meant to prevent infinite rerenders and\n  other antipatterns.\n\n  This hook is only called for helpers with the `hasScheduledEffect` capability\n  enabled. This hook is also not called in SSR currently, though this could be\n  added as a capability in the future. It has the following timing semantics:\n\n  **Always**\n  - called after the helper was first created, if the helper has not been\n    destroyed since creation\n  - called after autotracked state has changed, if the helper has not been\n    destroyed during render\n\n  **Never**\n  - called if the `hasScheduledEffect` capability is disabled\n  - called in SSR\n\n  #### `getDestroyable`\n\n  `getDestroyable` is an optional hook that users can use to register a\n  destroyable object for the helper. This destroyable will be registered to the\n  containing block or template parent, and will be destroyed when it is destroyed.\n  See the [Destroyables RFC](https://github.com/emberjs/rfcs/blob/master/text/0580-destroyables.md)\n  for more details.\n\n  `getDestroyable` is only called if the `hasDestroyable` capability is enabled.\n\n  This hook has the following timing semantics:\n\n  **Always**\n  - called immediately after the `createHelper` hook is called\n\n  **Never**\n  - called if the `hasDestroyable` capability is disabled\n\n  @method setHelperManager\n  @for @ember/helper\n  @static\n  @param {Function} factory A factory function which receives an optional owner, and returns a helper manager\n  @param {object} definition The definition to associate the manager factory with\n  @return {object} The definition passed into setHelperManager\n  @public\n*/\nexport const setHelperManager = glimmerSetHelperManager;\n\n/**\n  The `invokeHelper` function can be used to create a helper instance in\n  JavaScript.\n\n  To access a helper's value you have to use `getValue` from\n  `@glimmer/tracking/primitives/cache`.\n\n  ```js\n  // app/components/data-loader.js\n  import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n  import { getValue } from '@glimmer/tracking/primitives/cache';\n  import Helper from '@ember/component/helper';\n  import { invokeHelper } from '@ember/helper';\n\n  class PlusOne extends Helper {\n    compute([number]) {\n      return number + 1;\n    }\n  }\n\n  export default class PlusOneComponent extends Component {\n    plusOne = invokeHelper(this, PlusOne, () => {\n      return {\n        positional: [this.args.number],\n      };\n    });\n\n    get value() {\n      return getValue(this.plusOne);\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n  ```js\n  {{this.value}}\n  ```\n\n  It receives three arguments:\n\n  * `context`: The parent context of the helper. When the parent is torn down and\n    removed, the helper will be as well.\n  * `definition`: The definition of the helper.\n  * `computeArgs`: An optional function that produces the arguments to the helper.\n    The function receives the parent context as an argument, and must return an\n    object with a `positional` property that is an array and/or a `named`\n    property that is an object.\n\n  And it returns a Cache instance that contains the most recent value of the\n  helper.

By default, values that are rendered in Ember app\n  templates are _static_, meaning that updates to them won't cause the\n  application to rerender. Marking a property as tracked means that when that\n  property changes, any templates that used that property, directly or\n  indirectly, will rerender. For instance, consider this component:\n\n  ```handlebars\n  <div>Count: {{this.count}}</div>\n  <div>Times Ten: {{this.timesTen}}</div>\n  <div>\n    <button {{on \"click\" this.plusOne}}>\n      Plus One\n    </button>\n  </div>\n  ```\n\n  ```javascript\n  import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n  import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';\n  import { action } from '@ember/object';\n\n  export default class CounterComponent extends Component {\n    @tracked count = 0;\n\n    get timesTen() {\n      return this.count * 10;\n    }\n\n    @action\n    plusOne() {\n      this.count += 1;\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Both the `{{this.count}}` and the `{{this.timesTen}}` properties in the\n  template will update whenever the button is clicked. Any tracked properties\n  that are used in any way to calculate a value that is used in the template\n  will cause a rerender when updated - this includes through method calls and\n  other means:\n\n  ```javascript\n  import Component from '@glimmer/component';\n  import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';\n\n  class Entry {\n    @tracked name;\n    @tracked phoneNumber;\n\n    constructor(name, phoneNumber) {\n      this.name = name;\n      this.phoneNumber = phoneNumber;\n    }\n  }\n\n  export default class PhoneBookComponent extends Component {\n    entries = [\n      new Entry('Pizza Palace', 5551234),\n      new Entry('1st Street Cleaners', 5554321),\n      new Entry('Plants R Us', 5552468),\n    ];\n\n    // Any usage of this property will update whenever any of the names in the\n    // entries arrays are updated\n    get names() {\n      return this.entries.map(e => e.name);\n    }\n\n    // Any usage of this property will update whenever any of the numbers in the\n    // entries arrays are updated\n    get numbers() {\n      return this.getFormattedNumbers();\n    }\n\n    getFormattedNumbers() {\n      return this.entries\n        .map(e => e.phoneNumber)\n        .map(number => {\n          let numberString = '' + number;\n\n          return numberString.slice(0, 3) + '-' + numberString.slice(3);\n        });\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  It's important to note that setting tracked properties will always trigger an\n  update, even if the property is set to the same value as it was before.\n\n  ```js\n  let entry = new Entry('Pizza Palace', 5551234);\n  // if entry was used when rendering, this would cause a rerender, even though\n  // the name is being set to the same value as it was before\n  entry.name = entry.name;\n  ```\n\n  `tracked` can also be used with the classic Ember object model in a similar\n  manner to classic computed properties:\n\n  ```javascript\n  import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n  import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';\n\n  const Entry = EmberObject.extend({\n    name: tracked(),\n    phoneNumber: tracked()\n  });\n  ```\n\n  Often this is unnecessary, but to ensure robust auto-tracking behavior it is\n  advisable to mark tracked state appropriately wherever possible.\n  This form of `tracked` also accepts an optional configuration object\n  containing either an initial `value` or an `initializer` function (but not\n  both).\n\n  ```javascript\n  import EmberObject from '@ember/object';\n  import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';\n\n  const Entry = EmberObject.extend({\n    name: tracked({ value: 'Zoey' }),\n    favoriteSongs: tracked({\n      initializer: () => ['Raspberry Beret', 'Time After Time']\n    })\n  });\n  ```\n\n  @method tracked\n  @static\n  @for @glimmer/tracking\n  @public\n*/\n\n/**\n  The `@cached` decorator can be used on getters in order to cache the return\n  value of the getter. This is useful when a getter is expensive and used very\n  often. For instance, in this guest list class, we have the `sortedGuests`\n  getter that sorts the guests alphabetically:\n\n  ```js\n  import { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';\n\n  class GuestList {\n    @tracked guests = ['Zoey', 'Tomster'];\n\n    get sortedGuests() {\n      return this.guests.slice().sort()\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Every time `sortedGuests` is accessed, a new array will be created and sorted,\n  because JavaScript getters do not cache by default. When the guest list is\n  small, like the one in the example, this is not a problem. However, if the guest\n  list were to grow very large, it would mean that we would be doing a large\n  amount of work each time we accessed `sortedGetters`. With `@cached`, we can\n  cache the value instead:\n\n  ```js\n  import { tracked, cached } from '@glimmer/tracking';\n\n  class GuestList {\n    @tracked guests = ['Zoey', 'Tomster'];\n\n    @cached\n    get sortedGuests() {\n      return this.guests.slice().sort()\n    }\n  }\n  ```\n\n  Now the `sortedGuests` getter will be cached based on _autotracking_. It will\n  only rerun and create a new sorted array when the `guests` tracked property is\n  updated.\n\n  In general, you should avoid using `@cached` unless you have confirmed that the\n  getter you are decorating is computationally expensive. `@cached` adds a small\n  amount of overhead to the getter, making it more expensive. While this overhead\n  is small, if `@cached` is overused it can add up to a large impact overall in\n  your app. Many getters and tracked properties are only accessed once, rendered,\n  and then never rerendered, so adding `@cached` when it is unnecessary can\n  negatively impact performance.\n\n  @method cached\n  @static\n  @for @glimmer/tracking\n  @public\n */\n","/**\n@module
